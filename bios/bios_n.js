        narrative: `
            The Center for New Words began as a bookstore and for twenty-eight years was one of the largest
            and longest-running women's bookstores in the country. Founded by four Cambridge
            women, Rita Arditti, Gilda Bruckman, Mary
            Lowry, and Jean MacRae, New Words opened in April 1974 at 419 Washington Street
            in Somerville and moved to 186 Hampshire Street in Cambridge in 1976. 
            
            <Br><Br>They
            chose the store's name from a passage by noted feminist author Mary Daly:<blockquote>
            &#8220;Women are hearing ourselves and each other for the first time, and out
            of that creative hearing emerge new words.&#8221;</blockquote>The bookstore carried a wide
            selection of books by and about women, feminism, and lesbian issues, along with children's books, music, posters,
            jewelry, bumper stickers, and buttons. At its heyday, the bookstore was a center
            of feminist activity and lesbian gatherings in the Cambridge area, reaching out into the wider community.
            Throughout its history, New Words hosted readings and talks by significant women
            authors and served as an informal community center, offering workshops, bulletin
            boards, roommate listings and a place for like-minded women to meet and discuss
            a variety of issues. 
            
            <Br><Br>After serving the community for decades, the organizers
            began to search for a new model that would not depend on book sales. With a
            grant from the Ford Foundation to examine how New Words might serve as a pilot
            organization offering a model for other feminist organizations faced with financial
            and structural stresses. After 28 years in business, New Words Bookstore closed
            its doors on October 6, 2002 and moved its mission into the nonprofit Center
            for New Words (CNW) located on the second floor of the YWCA at 7 Temple Street. In 2010, CNW
            became Women, Action, & the Media, at the same location.<Br><Br> The
