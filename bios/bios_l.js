            Florence
            Ladd grew up in Washington, D.C. Her father was clerk of the local board of
            education. She became interested in psychology as a teenager, when she typed
            papers for her mother, who was preparing herself to be a teacher in special
            education. Florence attended Howard University, graduating in 1953 with a major
            in psychology. She spent a semester in France and Switzerland studying psychological
            testing procedures. She went on to do graduate work in social psychology at
            the University of Rochester, receiving a Ph.D. in 1958. <br><br>
            Ladd taught psychology at Simmons College, and
            did research at a hospital for the elderly in Framingham, Mass. When her husband
            received a Fulbright Scholarship, Ladd went with him to Turkey. She taught at
            Robert College and the American College for Girls in Istanbul, an experience
            that spurred her to combine social psychology with environmental studies. She
            received a certificate in community psychiatry in 1965 and taught related courses
            at Harvard University's Graduate School of Education and Graduate School of
            Design between 1965 and 1977.<br><br>
            Her gifts as an administrator were recognized,
            and she began to serve as a dean at the MIT School of Architecture. She moved
            to Wellesley College in 1979 as Dean of Students, remaining there until 1984,
            strengthening the relationship between Wellesley and MIT. She moved on to an
            international stage with her work as associate executive director of Oxfam America
            acting as liaison to the United Nations and as consultant to the Institute of
            International Education's South African Education Program. In 1989, she became
            the director of the Bunting Institute at Radcliffe College, a post she held
            until 1997. <br><br>
            Surrounded by creative women, Ladd was inspired
            to write her first novel, Sarah's Psalm, which was published in 1996. This received
            the Best Fiction Award from the Black Caucus of the American Library Association
            the following year. Ladd has served as trustee of the National Council for Research
            on Women, Bentley College, Hampshire College and Boston's Institute of Contemporary
            Art. She has been an overseer of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and WGBH. In
            2007, she was appointed as chair of the Board of Trustees of Hampshire College,
            from which her son, Michael Ladd, a poet and performer, graduated. She lives
            in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Flavigny-sur-Ozerain in Burgundy, France.`,

            University. Because of developing schizophrenia and substance abuse, she became
            homeless, but learned to manage her problems, becoming a leader in the mental

            to lead and encourage those involved in producing <em>Spare Change</em>. She
            has participated in events discussing journalism for the homeless. She was a

            Made part of the permanent staff in 1902, she was named chief of the photographic

        <p>Born
            in what is now Panama in 1872, Edith Lesley was the daughter of Alonzo and Rebecca
            Cousens Lesley. At age two, she moved to Bangor, Maine with her family where
            her father worked as a shoemaker and her mother took in boarders. She attended
            Bangor public schools and studied privately in lieu of high school. When she
            was eighteen, the family moved to Boston and later settled in Cambridge.<br><br>
             Edith
            Lesley studied to be a teacher at the Anne L. Page Kindergarten School in Boston,
            which followed the principles of kindergarten founder Friedrich Froebel. By
            1898, both she and her sister Olive were teaching kindergarten at the Riverside
            School in Cambridge. She later moved to the Houghton School where she became
            the principal kindergarten teacher. Between 1904 and 1908, Edith Lesley studied
            philosophy as a special student at Radcliffe College, likely in preparation
            for opening her own school.<br><br>
             In
            1909, Edith Lesley founded The Lesley School, known also as the Lesley Normal
            School in its early years. The primary purpose of the school was to train young
            women in kindergarten education. She initially rented rooms at the Cambridge
            School for Girls at 36 Concord Ave. for classes before moving them to her family's
            home at 29 Everett Street. She and her sister ran the school part-time for three
            years while continuing to teach at the Houghton School. In 1912, after she married
            engineer and inventor Merl R. Wolfard, Edith Lesley resigned from her teaching
            job at the Cambridge schools to run The Lesley School full-time, adding a program
            in primary teacher training. In 1915, Edith Lesley purchased the house her family
            had long rented at 29 Everett Street. Merl Wolfard, who served as an advisor
            and investor, later purchased additional nearby houses to serve as dormitories.<br>
             Edith
            Lesley hired Boston kindergarten teacher Gertrude Malloch in 1914 as a part-time
            instructor. Malloch soon became a valued friend, administrator and the first
            principal of the School. Enrollment grew rapidly in the 1920s and the School
            gained a solid reputation in teacher training, expanding its curriculum to include
            liberal arts courses and a program in household arts. <br><br>By 1928, the School had
            grown to include a campus quadrangle, extending between Everett and Mellen Streets.
            Though the School struggled to maintain enrollment during the Depression, Edith
            Lesley's achievements were recognized in 1938 when she was awarded an
            honorary degree from Suffolk University. By 1941, she began to experience chronic
            illness and withdrew from direct involvement in the School, though she continued
            to serve as a trustee until 1947. Chartered by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
            in 1943, Lesley College became a four-year, not-for-profit educational institution
            authorized to confer bachelor's degrees. Edith Lesley continued to live
            at 29 Everett Street until her death in 1953.<br><br>
             After
            her death, Lesley College continued to flourish, establishing graduate schools
            of education, management, arts and social sciences, and incorporating the Art
            Institute of Boston in 1999. Reflecting the breadth of its academic mission
            and programs, the institution Edith Lesley founded was renamed Lesley University
            in 2000. `,

            Emily Lewis was born Emily Barron on February
            22, 1908 in Adams Run, South Carolina. Shortly there after, she moved to Cambridge,
            MA where she was raised by the family of Leila and Henry Springer. She attended
            Webster Grammar School (on Upton Street) and continued her education at Cambridge
            High &amp; Latin School. Emily's husband, Arthur Lewis, died in 1973 and Emily
            died on May 20, 1997 at the age of 89. She is survived by her daughter, Florence,
            of Cambridge, MA and her son, William Lewis, Jr., who resides in Whitinsville,
            MA.<br><br>
            Emily
            was employed as a nurse. The opportunity arose during World War II when the
            call went out from the Red Cross for Nurses' Aides. Emily applied and
            with the support of several women with whom she had served on various health
            related committees, she overcame the Red Cross initial reluctance to admit her.
            Thus, she became the first woman of color in the very first class of Nurses'
            Aides. She completed the class work and upon entering the next phase of the
            course, she was assigned to cleaning the supply closets. She, supported by the
            members of her class, objected and she was subsequently assigned to the patient
            care work for which she had been trained. Emily took every opportunity for training
            and to increase her knowledge and eventually joined the staff of the Allerton
            Hospital in Brookline in the OBS delivery room. Her care and concern for her
            patients led to such esteem for her that several patients named their daughters
            after her. The Allerton Hospital later moved to a new innovative round structure
            in Brookline and became the Brookline Hospital. The hospital ultimately closed
            the OBS unit. Emily, having prepared herself with further training, passed the
            examination, became a Licensed Practical Nurse, and joined the staff of the
            Brookline Hospital's new Intensive Care Unit. After some forty years of
            service there, she retired.<br><br>
            Her
            community contributions include membership on the fund raising committee for
            the building of the current Cambridge Community Center facility. She served
            many years on the Board of Directors there. Her initial volunteer work at the
            Center included, helping to establish the Health Unit, which worked in concert
            with the Cambridge Tuberculosis Association. They worked offering support and
            encouragement to TB patients at the Cambridge Sanitarium through personal visits
            and presentations. The Health Unit's work included classes and workshops
            in pregnancy, preparing for newborns with emphasis on nutrition and care and
            the establishment of well-baby clinics. The members of the Unit raised funds
            through home luncheons, and Sunday Afternoon Teas. In
            answer to a disparaging remark about the Western Avenue community not being
            a reliable source of charity, Emily spearheaded a committee and the community
            responded by presenting United Fund (now the United Way) with an eye-opening

            A life long resident of Cambridge, Alice Mary
            Longfellow was the oldest daughter of the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and
            his wife, Fanny Appleton. She grew up in the family home at 105 Brattle Street
            (now the Longfellow National Historic Site) and was inspired to devote herself
            to preservation of historic homes and to education for women. <br><br>As a young woman
            in the 1870s, Alice helped to form the first community theater group in Cambridge.
            She joined the organizing committee with Elizabeth Cary Agassiz for the Harvard
            Annex or the Society for the Collegiate Instruction for Women (which later became
            Radcliffe College), as its youngest member. She attended its first class as
            a special student. Early commencements of Radcliffe College were held in the
            library of her home. She served on the Radcliffe College executive committee
            and the Board of Trustees of the college until the end of her life. In recognition
            of her work as a benefactor of the college, Longfellow Hall was named in her
            honor. <br><br>
            As a preservationist, Alice was a member of the
            Mount Vernon Ladies Association, the Society for the Preservation of New England
            Antiquities, and the Cambridge Historical Society. She led her family in the
            preservation of the Longfellow House and was responsible for the development
            of its gardens. She also opened the house to the general public, including children
            and students. Her philanthropic work extended to the Cambridge public schools,
            public gardens and playgrounds in the 20th century. She was keenly interested
            in the Arts and Crafts movement in Massachusetts and became a member of the
            Society of Arts and Crafts, Boston. In 1901, she published a reprint of her
            father's poem &#8220;Song of Hiawatha&#8221; with her account of a visit
            to the Objiway people in Ontario, where she was made an honorary tribal member.

        narrative: `
            Maria (White) Lowell was born in Watertown to
            Abijah White and Anna Maria (Howard) White. Maria attended the Ursuline Convent
            School in Charleston, but her formal education ended in 1834, when the school
            burned down. Five years later, Maria joined a group of &#8220;well-educated
            and thinking women,&#8221; whom Margaret Fuller
            guided in her &#8220;Conversations.&#8221; The goal of these women was stated
            to be: &#8220;What were we born to do and how shall we do it&#8221;? Maria was
            also a member of the &#8220;Band,&#8221; a club for Harvard students and their
            sisters. An ardent abolitionist, she worked to raise money for that cause and
            contributed poems to the abolitionist periodical, the Liberty Bell. <br><br>
            On December 26, 1844, Maria married the poet James
            Russell Lowell, whose first book of poetry was dedicated to her. The couple
            lived in Cambridge where their first child, Blanche, was born. Sadly, Blanche
            died in 1847, and their second daughter, Rose, born in September of 1849, died
            after only 6 months. In 1850, Maria's son, Walter, was born. A year later
            the family went to Italy in hopes of restoring Maria's failing health;
            where Walter died in 1852. Only one child, Mabel, survived into adulthood, outliving
            both her parents. <br><br>
            Maria's poetry was published in Rufus Griswald's
            <em>Female Poets of America</em> and <em>Putnam's Magazine</em>. In 1853,
            one year after she returned from Italy, Maria died of tuberculosis at the Lowells'
            home in Cambridge. Although only sixteen of her poems were published during
            her lifetime, her husband published a memorial volume of Maria's poems
            in 1855. `,

            Lois (Hammersberg) Lowry was born on March 20, 1937 in Hawaii to Robert and
            Katharine (Landis) Hammersberg. Since her father was an Army dentist, the family
            went to Japan during the occupation following the end of WWII. Returning to
            the States, she attended a private school in Brooklyn and then went to Brown
            University for two years. She left after her sophomore year to marry Donald
            Grey Lowry in 1956. They settled in Maine, where they raised four children. <br><br>
            She worked part-time as a professional photographer while her husband studied
            for his law degree. Eventually, she returned to college in the late 60s and
            earned her degree from the University of Southern Maine in 1972 in the writing
            program. <br><br>
            Lois Lowry began by writing textbooks on Black American Literature and on
            American
            Revolutionary Literature in the mid-1970's. In the late 1970s, she began to
            write books for children, the first based on her childhood recollections of
            the death of her sister from cancer. This book, <em>A Season to Die</em> (1977) launched
            her into a successful career. That same year, she was divorced from her husband.
            She has produced 20 novels and won the Newbery Medal twice, as well as winning
            many other awards. Her books often cover difficult subjects such as adoption,
            mental illness, and the Holocaust. She is best known for her &#8220;Anastasia&#8221; series. <br>
            Lowry moved to Boston and then to West Cambridge, spending weekends in her
            19th-century farmhouse in New Hampshire.`,

            Florence
            Luscomb was a committed believer in world peace, women's liberation, and
            workers' unions, and a familiar figure at protest marches and rallies
            throughout her long life.<br><br>
            Born in Lowell, Massachusetts, to Hannah (Knox)
            and Otis Luscomb, her parents separated when she was a baby. Her maternal grandfather
            was a Republican Congressman from St. Louis, and her mother shared his love
            of politics. Her mother was active in the early women's suffrage movement,
            and Florence recalled being taken by her mother to hear Susan B. Anthony when
            Florence was five. <br><br>
            She attended Chauncy Hall, a private secondary
            school, and then went on to MIT, graduating in 1909 with a B.S. in Architecture,
            among the first women to receive this degree at MIT. Her interest was primarily
            in Landscape Architecture, a study that echoed her life long love of the outdoors.
            After graduation she practiced architecture with Ida A. Ryan, a fellow graduate,
            in Watertown until the First World War, when a building slump ended the demand
            for new residential housing. <br><br>
            In 1918, Luscomb left architecture to become executive
            secretary for the Boston Equal Suffrage Association, and began to sell copies
            of the <em>Woman's Journal</em> on Boston Common, and to give speeches
            on suffrage throughout New England. After 1920, she found full-time work in
            various socially concerned organizations. She was a founding member of the Boston
            League of Women Voters. She also worked with the Massachusetts Civic League,
            where she initiated prison reform, and was a significant member of the Joint
            Board of Sanitary Control, concerned with factory safety, and the Massachusetts
            branch of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom,with
            which she was associated for the rest of her life. She found employment as a
            labor organizer in Boston, and in 1927, she was inspector of safety conditions
            for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union.<br><br>


            She lived with her mother until her mother's
            death in 1933, when a small legacy from her grandfather allowed her to give
            up paid employment and devote herself to social reform and political activism.
            She worked for the Boston wing of the National Association for the Advancement
            of Colored People, for the Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, and the American
            League for Peace and Democracy, among other organizations. By the late &#8216;40s,
            she set up a co-operative household in Cambridge that offered like-minded women,
            including Radcliffe graduate students, a nurturing environment. <br><br>She continued
            this style of cooperative living with a new groups of young people into her
            nineties when illness compelled her to give up independent living. In the late
            1930s, she bought land in Tamworth, NH, where she designed and built a rustic
            cabin. Each year until she became almost blind, she spent the entire summer
            working in a carefully designed garden and climbing in the White Mountains.<br>
            Luscomb ran for public office at least four times,
            first for Boston City Council in 1922, losing by less than one percent of the
            vote.. She was a candidate for the US House of Representatives on the People's
            Labor Party. Most notably, when the Massachusetts state chair of the Progressive
            Party, she ran for governor in 1952. <br><br>At the age of 71, she turned out for a
            &#8220;March for Peace&#8221; in 1958 to the United Nations, walking from New
            Haven to Manhattan to appeal for an end to nuclear weapons testing. In the early
            1960s, she traveled to Cuba, attended a peace conference in Moscow, and then
            went on to China, in spite of US policy forbidding such travel. On her return,
            she lectured on China and continued to work for peace movements. In her eighties,
            she was rediscovered by the women's movement as one of its &#8220;foremothers&#8221;
            and began a new lecture career, speaking throughout the country. She also was
            active in the anti-Vietnam War movement, joining marches and speaking out on
            behalf of the peace movement. <br><br>During this period, she continued to work for
            improved racial relations and on behalf of school busing. She reminded her fellow
            feminists that women included poor and minority women, and served as a consultant
            to the young women organizing the professional labor union, Nine to Five. At
            a celebration of her ninetieth birthday in 1976, she was feted by leaders of
            all the organizations with whom she had worked. On this occasion, she urged
            her listeners to think about social justice with the words: &#8220;It's
            time for a second American revolution.&#8221; <br><br>
             In her mid-nineties, ill health forced her into a nursing
            home in Watertown, where she died at the age of ninety-eight.`,
