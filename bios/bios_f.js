            Susan 
            Fleischmann is a photographer who has worked on behalf of community-based media 
            and television in Cambridge since 1976. She graduated from New England School 
            of Photography with an Associates Degree in 1976 and a BA in Media and Women's 
            Studies in 1981 from University of Massachusetts, Amherst. In the academic year 
            1999-2000, she was a fellow in the Center for Reflective Community at MIT. She 
            has documented social action movements, including the women's movement, 
            as photographer and videographer as a free-lance photographer from 1976 to 1988. 
            Her photographs regularly appeared in <em>Gay Community News</em>, <em>Off Our 
            Backs</em>, and <em>Equal Times</em>. <br><br>
            She began as a media arts activist when the cable 
            franchise hearings were held in Boston in 1981. From the time that Cambridge 
            Community Television (CCTV) opened in 1988, she joined the organization and 
            served at first as Access Manager. In 1993, she was made Executive Director 
            and since that time has been an articulate leader, diversifying the channel's 
            funding base, expanding the access of the public to diverse media and technologies 
            by opening a computer lab and an arts gallery, the Drive-by Gallery. Under her 
            management, CCTV won &#8220;Overall Excellence in Public Access Programming&#8221; 
            six times in the past fifteen years in the Hometown Video Festival sponsored 
            by the national organization, Alliance for Community Media, most recently in 
            2008. <br><br>
            Fleischmann has won a number of awards for her 
            photography and more recently as Person of the Year from TAB Community Newspaper 
            in 1998. The Cambridge Lavender Alliance awarded her a Community Recognition 
            Award in 2003, and CCTV recognized her with an award in 2008. <br>

            Focus Counseling for Women and Their Friends, founded by Bonnie Engelhardt, Sarah Greenberg, Beverly Sclar, and 
            Libby Zimmerman at 186 and 186 1/2 Hampshire Street, started with a mission to offer a feminist approach for clients seeking counseling, and provide 
            a feminist community for the staff. Focus welcomed clients of all sexual orientations and gender identities. It 
            wasn&rsquo;t until 1973, the year Focus was established, that homosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic &amp; 
            Statistical Manual (DSM) as a pathological diagnosis.<br><br>
            During the 1970s collectives were a common approach to organizations involved in feminist work, and Focus was 
            no exception. The practice started as an economic collective where each therapist was paid an equal hourly wage 
            regardless of academic or clinical degree. Sliding scale fees were offered to ensure that clients would not be turned 
            away due to financial constraints.<br><br>
            In the mid-1970s, Focus collaborated with other mental health organizations to form a larger collective. With several
            therapy practices emerging at the time, the goal of this &ldquo;Collective of Collectives&rdquo; was to be supportive
                rather than competitive. Organizations included the Somerville Women&rsquo;s Mental Health Collective, the 
                Women&rsquo;s Center in Cambridge, Tapestry, Libra, and others. From 1985-1995,  Focus created and hosted a 
                speaker series, &ldquo;Families in Focus,&rdquo; that touched on topics of feminist thinking and relational 
                perspectives. CEU&rsquo;s were offered to practitioners.<br><br>
            As members joined and left the practice, a core group emerged who offered general psychotherapy and support on 
            issues that were often marginalized or stigmatized, such as infertility and adoption, 
            lesbian and gay support, grief and bereavement after suicide, sexual addiction, and early childhood emotional 
            development. In the 1990s, focus moved away from an economic collective to a group practice model but stayed 
            in community with one another through supervision meetings, shared office space, business meetings, and a 
            shared commitment to provide quality psychotherapy services within a feminist perspective.

        narrative: `
  Gladys Friedler, called &#8220;Gaby&#8221; by 
      her friends, was born in Lewiston, Maine to Anna and Max Herman Friedler. After 
      attending the Lewiston public schools, she received her Bachelor's degree 
      from the University of Maine; her master's degree from the University
      of Pennsylvania and her PhD in Medical Sciences from Boston University in
      1968.
      She went on to do postgraduate work at University of California San Francisco
      Medical Center (UCSF) and then returned to the Boston area with a research
      fellowship
      at Harvard Medical School from 1970 to 1972. <br><br>From 1972 until 1999, she was
      an Associate Professor of Pharmacology and Psychiatry at Boston University
      Medical
      School. She was one of the first to study paternal effects of various drugs
      on the fetus. <br><br>
  In her research on rodents, Friedler pointed out 
      that exposure &quot;can induce long-term changes in the normal developmental 
      and behavioral patterns of subsequent offspring&#8221; of males exposed to addictive 
      and therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins, and alcohol. (&#8220;Paternal Exposures: 
      Impact on Reproductive and Developmental Outcomes. An Overview. Pharmacology 
      Biochemistry and Behavior 55(1996) 691-700). She received national attention 
      in the media when she organized a session &#8220;The Father and the Fetus&#8221; in
      March 1991 at the AAAS meeting in Washington, DC. Since that time, her work
      has been often cited as ground-breaking. She was awarded a Bunting fellowship
      at Radcliffe in 1991 and has remained active in that organization. She is
      presently
      professor <em>emerita</em> at Boston University.<br><br>
    A skilled singer, Gaby Friedler sang folk songs in the caf&eacute;s of Cambridge
      in the late 50s and continues to sing with choral groups in Cambridge, Arlington,
      and Woods Hole. She has been politically active in the life of Cambridge
      throughout
      her residency in the city. <br>

 Mary 
    Hamilton Frye was born in Salem, Massachusetts on April 18, 1890 to Nathan Frye and 
    Alice H. Chase Frye. She had three brothers Charles, Francis, and John. The 
    family moved from Salem to Cambridge around 1896. They lived for many years 
    at 10 Acacia Street in Cambridge.<br><br>
     Miss Frye attended the Boston School of the Museum 
    of Fine Arts and was a member of the Boston Society of Arts and Crafts. In her 
    early twenties, she illustrated children's books, including the <em>Wonderful 
    Adventures of Nils</em> by Swedish author Selma Lagerlof. 
    A 1913 Houston Post article describes how Frye came to illustrate "The Wonderful Adventure of Nils.":
<blockquote>
"Miss Frye read Selma Lagerlof's children's classic...a few years ago. Her imagination was immediately
 fired by the subtle charm of the tales, and for her own satisfaction, she set about illustrating them.
  She had no idea of selling the drawings—in fact [she] gave them away to a friend. It was W. S. Booth 
  of Boston who discerned the imaginative beauty and appropriateness of the pictures and suggested that 
  they be submitted to Double Day, Page & Co. Their acceptance was immediate, and the new edition of "Nils" is the result..."
</blockquote>



    She was a friend of 
    New Hampshire painter Maxfield Parrish. She exhibited with the Cambridge Art 
    League and the Boston Society of Arts and Crafts.<br><br>
     Frye's art career evolved into designing and creating 
    stained glass windows. She studied in London with the English stained glass 
    artist Christopher Whall and in Boston with Charles Connick. She opened her 
    own stained glass studio on Church Street in Cambridge in 1920. She designed 
    stained glass windows for churches in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia and Mechanicsville, 
    New York. Locally, she designed windows at Bertram and Eliot halls in the Radcliffe 
    Quadrangle. <br><br>
     Frye moved from Cambridge to Concord, Massachusetts in 1949 
    and worked at the Boston Museum of Science as an artist. She died of breast 
    cancer at the age of 61 on May 18, 1951 and is buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery 
    in Concord.

        narrative: `
    Born to Timothy and Margaret (Crane) Fuller in 
    1810, Sarah Margaret Fuller grew up in Cambridge. She also went by the name Marchesa Margaret F. Ossoli. Her father gave her a very 
    thorough education in Latin and world literature. She studied at a girl's 
    school in Groton and continued her education at home and at Mr. Perkins school 
    where she learned Greek. <br><br>By her late teens, she was considered a prodigy and 
    made early friendships with a number of young Harvard men who later joined the 
    Transcendentalist movement inspired by Ralph Waldo Emerson. Her father died 
    when she was in her mid twenties and she began to teach in Boston at Bronson 
    Alcott's Temple School, where she met her fellow teacher and activist, 
    Elizabeth Peabody. By 1839, she had moved to Jamaica Plain and began to work 
    closely with the leaders of the Trancendentalist movement, offering &#8220;Conversations&#8221; 
    to interested men and women on topics that ranged from women's rights 
    to philosophy. She also joined Emerson in editing and writing for the Transcendentalist 
    journal, <em>The Dial</em>. <br><br>
    In 1844, she moved to New York to write critical 
    essays on literature and art for Horace Greeley's newspaper, the <em>New 
    York Tribune</em>. During this period, she published her most influential book, 
    <em>Woman in the Nineteenth Century</em> (1845). Two years later, she was given 
    the opportunity to travel to Europe as the <em>Tribune</em>'s foreign 
    correspondent. <br><br>
In 
    England, she met many famous literary men and women and the Italian exile and 
    republican revolutionary, Giuseppi Mazzini. She traveled on to France and then 
    to Italy where she met her future husband, Giovanni Angelo Ossoli who was a 
    friend of Mazzini and, like him, involved in the republican movement that overthrew 
    the government in Rome in 1848. Fuller also dedicated herself to this revolution, 
    and married Ossoli only after the birth of her son. During this period she worked 
    closely with her husband, taking supplies to his unit and organizing an emergency 
    hospital during the siege of Rome by the French. <br><br>
    After the overthrow of the Italian republic in 
    July of 1849, she fled to Florence with her husband and son and began to write 
    a history of the Italian revolution. The family took passage on a ship sailing 
    to New York in May 1850, but the ship floundered in a storm near Long Island 
    and all three Ossolis perished. Her body and her manuscript was never found. 
    A memorial tablet was erected in Mount Auburn Cemetery to her and her husband 
    near the burial of her child, whose body was the only one recovered from the 
    shipwreck. <br><br>
    Margaret Fuller's family home in Cambridgeport 
    (built 1807) is located at 71 Cherry Street and was converted for use as a neighborhood 
    settlement house in 1902. The Margaret Fuller Neighborhood House is still actively 
    serving the local community today, assisting over 1,500 people each year with 
    educational, support, outreach, and community services.<br>

        Goldie Lane grew up at 189 Windsor Street in Cambridge, the daughter of William Lane
         (born in North Carolina) and Alice Twine (born in Massachusetts). In 1908, at age 24, Goldie became 
         a teacher at the Boardman School at 105 Windsor Street, just a block away from her home. 
         <br><Br>Cambridge
          resident <a href="bios.html?ln=Thompson&mN=Crutchfield&fN=Mary">Mary Crutchfield Thompson</a>
           (one of the first African Americans to graduate from Tufts Dental School) recalled Lane in a
            1977 interview:<blockquote> "They used to have the Boardman School right across from where the Newtowne
             Court housing project is. And we had one black teacher there. Her name was Goldie Lane; 
             her father was a physician in Cambridge."</blockquote>

        In September of 1906, Lane contributed to a Labor Day celebration that took place on the Charles at the foot of the
         Massachusetts Avenue bridge, where local Black authors and clergy gathered and spoke on a variety of
          issues related to the local Black community. Lane read an essay that day, as did 
          <a href="bios.html?ln=Brown&mN=Eugenia&fN=Charlotte">Charlotte Hawkins</a>,
           who had recently founded her own school in North Carolina.  <Br><Br>

        In September of 1909, Lane again gave a reading, this time at a reception specifically for 
        <a href="bios.html?ln=Brown&mN=Eugenia&fN=Charlotte">Charlotte Hawkins</a>. 
        At the same reception, <A href="bios.html?ln=Baldwin&mN=Louisa&fN=Maria">Maria Baldwin</a>,
         another Cambridge teacher and writer, gave a talk on 
         "the educational uplift of colored women."
        <Br><br>
        In February of 1910, Goldie Lane married Horace Hastings Franks, a porter originally from Norwell, 
        Massachusetts, and shortly thereafter, Lane resigned from her teaching position, as was required of 
        married teachers at that time. She and her husband had two children, Horace Jr. in 1911 and Elsie May in 1915.

        <br><br>
         Sadly, in March of 1916, at the age of 34 and despite being in good health, Goldie Franks died suddenly. 
         Her death was attributed to "heart trouble." The couple had been living at 99 Howard Street at the time. The CWHP could 
        not find a photograph of Goldie, but have included one of her daughter Elsie May Franks.
