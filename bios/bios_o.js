            The Oral History Center emerged in 1980, envisioned by oral historian Cindy Cohen, as a
            collaboration between the Cambridge Arts Council and the Cambridge Social History Resource Center. The goal
            was to build stronger communities not only by documenting oral histories but by bringing people together, in
            one-on-one interviews, to overcome stereotypes and prejudices, believing that <blockquote>&ldquo;...the lives of regular
            people are important and deserve to be documented.&rdquo;</blockquote> The center was housed at 186 hampshire Street.<Br>
            Examples of interview pairs from Cambridge, Roxbury, Lawrence, and Central
            America included: High school girls and older women; Spanish-speaking and English-speaking youth; Jewish and
            Palestinian women; Public and parochial students; and Mayan, Creole, and Garifuna women. <br><Br>
            One of the Center&rsquo;s first projects of the Oral History Center was the
            Cambridge Women&rsquo;s Quilt. Sixty women and girls, ages 8 to 80, sewed quilt patches together to document
            their individual lives. They interviewed each other about their quilt and a group of youths worked with
            singer and songwriter Betsy Rose to compose a ballad about the quilt. In 1985, the quilt was exhibited in
            Nairobi, Kenya at the World Conference to review and appraise the Achievements of the UN Decade for
            Women.<br><Br>
            Eventually, the Center&rsquo;s work evolved into a curriculum that could be
            used in classrooms and other community settings. Workshops were provided to 6th, 7th, and 8th-grade teachers
            of Cambridge Public Schools to incorporate oral history into the social studies curriculum. This project
            lasted for five years, documenting 80 stories that were compiled into a book, &ldquo;The Mango Tree.&rdquo;
            A partnership with Northeastern University&rsquo;s Center for Innovation in Urban Education (where the Oral
            History Center would move to in 1995) led to professional development workshops for Boston Public Schools
            teachers. By 1990, a curriculum guide was developed for national distribution.<br><Br>
            The Oral History Center cared deeply about community accountability, and it
            involved community members in the design and evaluation of each program. The Center hosted folk art exhibits
            and educational events which grew beyond Cambridge into Boston and around the world. Several projects arose
            out of the Center, such as &ldquo;A Passion for Life: Stories and Folk Arts of Palestinian and Jewish
            Women,&rdquo; and The &ldquo;Griots of Roxbury,&rdquo; a publication that explored violence in the lives of
            five generations of Roxbury residents.<blockquote>
             &ldquo;Differences are used to create separations and fear because it is
            differences which are used to legitimize the unequal distribution of resources.&rdquo;<Br> (Oral History Center,
            1990)</blockquote>Beginning in the 1970s in Cambridge, oral histories became a community organizing tool. The Oral
            History Center and the Black Women&rsquo;s Oral History Project highlighted the importance of communicating
            across identities and documenting everyday people. The Black Women&rsquo;s Oral History Project included
            interviews with 72 African American women from
            Cambridge.`,

        narrative: `
            Caroline Frances Orne was the daughter of John
            Gerry Orne and his wife, Ann (Stone). She was brought up in Cambridge and educated
            in the Cambridge public schools and at a private school in Boston, Bailey's
            High School for Young Ladies. She was a childhood friend of the poet James Russell
            Lowell, which may have inspired her to write poetry herself. <Br><Br>In her twenties
            she began to publish children's stories and poetry, some of which had
            a national circulation. <em>Lucy's Party and Other Tales</em> (1842) was intended
            for children; <em>Sweet Auburn and Mount Auburn with Other Poems</em> (1844)
            described the grounds of Mount Auburn both before and after it became a cemetery.
            Her book of poetry, <em>Morning Songs of American Freedom</em> (1876), included
            patriotic poems, a number of which celebrated the courage of sea captains, from
            whom her father was descended. Longfellow thought well enough of her work to
            include one of her poems in his anthology, <em>Poems of Places</em> (1879).
            <br><Br>
            In 1858, the city of Cambridge purchased the Athenaeum
            (founded by Edmund Dana as a private library) and renamed it the Dana Library&#8212;Caroline
            Orne became its first librarian. She built up the holdings from 1,400 books
            to 7,000, and expanded its hours of operation. The library soon required more
            space, and in 1866, it was relocated to the old Masonic hall at the corner of
            Massachusetts Avenue and Temple Street. Orne remained as librarian until 1874,
            when she retired. She was succeeded by another woman librarian, Almira L. Hayward,
            who remained for the next twenty-two years. In 1879, the library was renamed
            as the Cambridge Public Library. <br><Br>
            Towards the end of her life, Orne became interested
            in her family history. She joined the Hannah Winthrop Chapter of the Daughters
            of the American Revolution and published a study of her mother's family,
            the Stone family, from the early 1630s, titled<em> A Pioneer in New England</em>
            (1887, reprinted 1930). When the organization published <em>An Historic Guide
                to Cambridge</em> in 1907, it included an account of her publications. Orne
            lived in her family home at 107 Auburn Street until her death in 1905. She is
            buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery with the rest of her family. `,
