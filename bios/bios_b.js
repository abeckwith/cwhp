            In 1985, The Back Porch Dance Company was founded
            as an interracial, intergenerational dance company with members whose ages
            ranged
            from over three generations. <br><br>The directors, Joan Green and Vicki Solomon brought
            together a group of women and girls for a six-week workshop that evolved into
            the company. During its lifespan, the company included both professional and
            amateur dancers, including Ann Allen, Carol Strickland, Pat Zeigler, Lise
            Brody,
            Rebecca Lay, Tatoyia Foster, Vernell Foster, Lucy Wilson, Danita Callendar,
            Sandra Marcelino, Maggie Goncalves, Genii Guinier, Marcie Osinksy, Shirley
            Santos,
            Evelyn Tyner, Rhea Dunn, Sara Reese, Aislinn Macmaster, Dorothy Elizabeth Tucker,
            Euridece Spinola, Carol Ryser, Amy Gerson Stephanie Hope, Jen Schoonover,
            Sally
            DeAngelis, and Mariah Pisha. <br><br>
             In May 2000, the company performed a piece of
            narrated dance theater at Kresge Auditorium, MIT, &#8220;Celebrating Cambridge
            Women and Work&#8221; honoring the diverse lives of eight working Cambridge
            women that included a curtain folder, biologist, homeless advocate, funeral

            home director, welder, library worker, MIT laboratory assistant, and psychiatrist.
            The oldest member of the company , World War II welder, Evelyn Tyner, eighty-two

            years old at the time, was one of the narrators . Though the company had built
            a solid reputation and performed throughout New England, it dissolved in
            2001,
            owing to changes in the lives of the directors. One of the directors, Joan
            Green, went on to teach elders and adults and to dance with the Elder Ensemble
            of Prometheus
            Dance Company, while the other director, Vicki Solomon, completed a Masters
            Degree in Library Science and began working full time in the Children's
            Room
            of the main branch of the Cambridge Public Library.<br>

            Born in Boston, the daughter of Francis V and
            Ellen (Noyes) Balch, Emily Greene Balch attended private schools and then went
            to Bryn Mawr College, graduating in its first senior class in 1889. She went
            on to study sociology and went to Paris on a Bryn Mawr fellowship in 1890-1891
            to study economics with Emile Levasseur. As a result, she published her first
            book, <em>Public Assistance of the Poor in France</em> (1893).<br><br> Balch returned
            to the U.S. to take courses at Harvard and the University of Chicago and spent
            a year studying economics in Berlin from 1895 to 1896. In 1896, she began to
            teach economics and sociology at Wellesley College and was named professor in
            1913. She also was a member of state and municipal commissions studying immigration
            and education. Active in the women's suffrage movement, she also worked
            for racial justice and for improvement in labor conditions. She became interested
            in the situation of Slavic &#8211;Americans and traveled throughout the Austro-Hungarian
            Empire to areas from which they had migrated for a book on the topic that was
            
            published in 1910. Opposed to the First World War, she was fired from Wellesley
            at the beginning of that war for &#8220;teaching pacifism not economics.&#8221;<br><br>
            Balch began to serve as an editor of the liberal
            journal, the <em>Nation</em>, and attended the second International Congress
            of Women in 1919, held in Zurich. There she was designated secretary of the
            new organization Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF),
            headquartered in Geneva where she remained until 1922. (She would serve as unpaid
            secretary again in 1934-5, when the League fell on hard times). Balch continued
            to assist a variety of commissions and international groups, including working
            for the League of Nations on topics such as disarmament, aviation, and drug
            control. For WILPF, she studied conditions in Haiti, then occupied by U.S. marines,
            and edited and was the primary contributor for the report published as <em>Occupied
                Haiti </em>(1926) that was significant in causing the U.S. to withdraw.<br><br> In the
            1930s, with the rise of facism and Nazism, she began to write about the victims
            of persecution. During the Second World War, she published a book of poetry
            and began to write on the need for future internationalization of aviation and
            waterways. <br><br>
            In 1946, Balch was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize
            for her work for peace and international cooperation. At seventy-nine and in
            frail health, she contributed the prize money awarded to her to WILPF, continuing
            to work with the organization in an honorary capacity. As late as 1949, she
            served as chair of a committee that honored the centenary of the sociologist
            Jane Addams, who had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931. Balch spent
            her last years in a Cambridge nursing home where she died at the age of ninety-four.

            from Cambridge High School in 1874. She graduated from Cambridge Teachers'
            Training School the following year.<br><br> When she was unable to find a position in
            the Boston area, Baldwin began a teaching career in Charlestown, Maryland. In 1882,
            pressure from the Cambridge African-American community resulted in the hiring

            of Baldwin as a primary school teacher at Agassiz Grammar School at 28 Sacramento
            Street. Seven years later, she was appointed principal of that school, the first
            black woman to be appointed as a principal in Massachusetts. Later, in 1916,
            when a new, larger building was built, she was appointed master of the school.
            <br><br>Always interested in new learning, she took many courses at Harvard and other
            schools throughout her life. She corresponded and worked with many men and women
            of distinction in the area. She also taught during the summer at Hampton Institute
            in Virginia and the Institute for Colored Youth in Cheyney, PA. The Agassiz
            school in Cambridge was rebuilt in 1995 and on May 21st, 2002, the Cambridge
            School Committee unanimously voted to rename the Agassiz School to the Maria
            L. Baldwin School in her honor.

            Born a slave, Louisa was given the name Mary Frances Melburn as a child which
            she changed to Louisa Jones when she fled to freedom. As a child, she grew up
            in a household in Hampton, Virginia, but was sold as a child to Captain Chapman
            who ran a steamboat line in that state. She was moved to Norfolk and then, as
            a young woman, bounded out to learn dressmaking until she was twenty-four. <br><br>In
            1857, being suspected of aiding slaves to escape to Philadelphia, she fled by
            traveling on a steamboat, disguised as a wealthy young Southerner. 
            When she reached Philadelphia, she found a reward
            being offered for her capture, which prompted her to change her name. She continued
            on to Boston, helped by friendly abolitionists. There in Boston, the story of
            her escape became known, and she was found a position as a dressmaker. Louisa
            continued to actively aid the abolitionist movement and abolitionists including
            Wendell Phillips and Charles Sumner. She knew from her first-hand experience
            the successful methods for escape. <br><br>In 1864, she married Archer H. Barlow, also
            an escaped slave. The couple moved to Cambridge around 1870 and set up house
            at 168 Elm Street in Cambridgeport. An active member of the Twelfth Street Baptist
            Church in Boston and various women's benevolent organizations, she died
            at the age of sixty- three. Her funeral was attended by representatives of the
            abolitionist families who had supported her as well as by the Black community.

            Mary Bancroft, author and intelligence officer
            for the Office of Strategic Services, was born in Cambridge, Mass., in 1903
            to Mary Agnes (Cogan) and Hugh Bancroft, later publisher of <em>The Wall Street
                Journal</em>. Her mother, who studied at Radcliffe College, died soon after
            Mary was born. As a child, Bancroft graduated from the Winsor School, in Boston
            in 1921. She entered Smith College in 1922, but left college after three months,
            and soon after married Sherwin Badger, figure skating champion, who had graduated
            from Harvard College and then took a position with the United Fruit Company.
            The young couple spent a year in Cuba. They had three children: two sons, one
            who died in infancy, and a daughter. The couple divorced in 1932. <br><br>
            In 1935, she married Jean Rufenacht, a Swiss businessman,
            and later moved to Zurich, where she was analyzed by and studied with C.G. Jung.
            Psychology became one of her life-long interests. With this background and her
            

            proficiency in French and German, she was hired by the Office of Strategic Services
            during the Second World War to work with Allen Dulles, whose lover she was briefly.
            As an agent, she analyzed speeches and writings of Nazi leaders, and wrote reports
            on conversations with German contacts, including Hans Bernd Gisevius, a German
            envoy to Switzerland who was involved in the early plots against Hitler. After
            the war, she divorced her Swiss husband in 1947, and then worked as a freelance
            journalist and translator. She returned to America in 1953, settling in New
            York City, where she lectured professionally and wrote novels, including <em>Upside
                Down in the Magnolia Tree</em> (1952), and <em>The Inseparables</em> (1958).
            She continued to work as a translator and publish book reviews. In 1983, she
            published a memoir, <em>Autobiography of a Spy</em>. <br><br>
            Bancroft became involved in Democratic politics,
            working on various campaigns. She continued her interest in Jungian psychology
            through her correspondence and membership in the Analytical Psychology Club
            of New York and the Jung Foundation and sat on the editorial board of <em>Psychological
                Perspectives</em> as consultant and book reviewer. She died in Manhattan on
            January 10, 1997. Her papers were given to the Schlesinger library.

            Charlotte Fiske Bates was born in New York City.
            Her father, Harvey Bates, died in her infancy, and from the time she was nine
            she lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She was educated in the public schools
            of Cambridge and began to write poetry when quite young.<br><br> For the first twenty-five
            years of her life she taught in private schools. She offered private instruction
            from her own home at 10 Ellery Street in the 1860s. Bates corresponded with
            Henry Wadsworth Longfellow from 1866 to 1882 and assisted Longfellow in compiling
            

            <em>Poems of Places</em> in a series of small volumes between 1875 and 1878,
            making ten translations for the work. She also edited the <em>Longfellow Birthday-Book</em>
            She is best known for <em>The Seven Voices of Sympathy</em> (1881) a compilation
            of Longfellow's prose and poetry. She issued a selection of poems from English
            and American authors in the <em>Cambridge Book of Poetry and Song</em> (1882).
            <br><br>In the late 1880s, she began to publish her poetry in <em>Lippincott</em> magazine
            and <em>Century</em> magazine on a regular basis and moved to New York City
            although she kept her ties to Cambridge. In 1891 she married a Frenchman, Adolphe
            Rog&eacute;, who died five years later. She organized and read at a Longfellow
            memorial meeting at Sanders theater that raised money for the Longfellow fund.
            Some of her poetry was set to music by different American composers. <br><br>Bates continued
            to publish and to participate in public readings until a few years before her
            death in 1916.

            De Ama Battle was born in the &#8220;Gold Coast&#8221;
            region of Cambridge (near Western Avenue) to James and Madge Haynes. She grew
            up in Davis Square, Somerville. By the time she was nine, DeAma developed into
            an artist whose medium was dance. Ethel Covan served as her &#8220;stage mother&#8221;
            and mentor which enabled her to study, perform and then teach with the Covanettes
            Dance Company. From the age of 14, De Ama acted as choreographer, arranged the
            childrens' performances at their yearly recital at John Hancock Hall,
            Boston. <br><br>
            She pursued further study of dance at the Elma Lewis School of Fine Arts and
            with Chuck Davis, director of the African American Dance Ensemble. Beginning
            in 1972, Battle began a series of trips to West Africa, Brazil, and Jamaica
            to study, lecture and perform. She helped found one of the first Pan African
            dance companies.<br><br>
            She has taught African-rooted dance forms at Tufts
            University, Wellesley College and the Boston Conservatory and has run a performance
            group for teens. In 1975, De Ama Battle founded the Art of Black Dance &amp;
            Music, a dynamic performance troupe comprising as many as twenty dancers and
            musicians. Under the musical direction of Bamedele Osumarea they developed,
            explored and disseminated an extended concept of African dance. Committed to
            the philosophy and goals of arts education as an essential part of school curricula,
            she has performed in Cambridge schools through the artist-in-residency program.
            She also holds a Masters' degree in Education from Cambridge College.
            <br><br>
            De Ama Battle has received a series of awards
            and recognition including the Elliot Norton award in 1992 for &#8220;bringing
            the heartbeat of Africa and the Carribean Islands to Boston.&#8221; In 1995,
            she was recognized with the Commonwealth award for her outstanding contribution
            to the arts of Massachusetts and in 1996, she was awarded an honorary degree
            in humane letters from Mount Ida College of Newton, Massachusetts. In 2006, De Ama Battle
            received the Boston Dance Alliance Lifetime Achievement award.

        narrative: `
            Mabel Hubbard was raised in Cambridge on Brattle
            Street. Her father, Gardiner Greene Hubbard who had a Boston law practice, helped
            establish a city water works in Cambridge, was a founder of the Cambridge Gas
            Co., and later organized a Cambridge to Boston trolley system. <br><br>Between ages
            four and five, Mabel became deaf as a result of scarlet fever. Her father founded
            the first American school for the deaf at Chelmsford, Mass. and served as trustee
            
            of the Clarke School for the deaf, which Mabel attended. <br><br>
            After Mabel went to Germany in her teens to study
            chemistry and the German language, she returned to Cambridge at the age of sixteen.
            Alexander Graham Bell had taught at the Clarke School and was then professor
            of vocal physiology and elocution at Boston University. He was hired by Mabel's
            father as a private tutor. Hubbard was also financing Bell's experiments

            on the telephone and helped organize his company. Mabel and Alexander became
            romantically involved, and at first her parents opposed the marriage objecting
            to the age disparity and fearing that their children would be deaf (since Bell's
            mother was congenitally deaf), but the two were engaged in 1875. In 1877, the
            couple married. They had two sons who died in infancy and two daughters who
            lived into adulthood. <br><br>
            Mabel supported her husband in his work, notably
            in his interest in aviation (the Aerial Experiment Association). In 1910, she
            became a strong supporter of women's rights and marched in the women's
            suffrage national convention in Washington in 1910. During World War I, she
            sponsored benefits to raise money for the Red Cross and fund lifeboats for the
            US Navy. She later founded the Montessori Education Association and became its
            president. Later she opened a school in Washington, D.C. and started a magazine,
            <em>Freedom for the Child</em>.<br><br>
            
            She
            died on January 3, 1923 in Washington D.C. and was buried on Cape Breton Island,
            Nova Scotia, Canada where the Bells had a summer home. Many of her letters to
            and from her husband are in the Bell Family Papers in the Library of Congress.

             The
            daughter of Saul and May Sidore, who owned a knitting factory in Manchester,
            New Hampshire, Sara Mae was the eldest of five children. She married Larry Berman in 1955
            and attended the Rhode Island School of Design, graduating in 1958 with a BFA
            in Interior Design. The couple moved to Cambridge in 1958, following her graduation,
            and had three children. They currently have six grandchildren.<br><br>
            Sara Mae and Larry founded the Cambridge Sports
            Union in 1962, the first competitive sports club in New England for men and
            women. The club includes
            competitive running, cross-country skiing, orienteering (a sport which combines
            cross country running or cross country skiing and land navigation), also, recently,
            race-walking.<br><br>
            By
            1964, under Larry's coaching, she had become a serious athlete in both running
            and cross country skiing. (In 1968-69, she was named to the first U.S. Women's
            National Nordic Team.) To build up her long distance, she ran, often unofficially,
            in men's road races. (The male runners welcomed her.) She and Larry decided
            to prepare her for running the Boston Marathon, although entry was still unofficial
            for women. In 1969, 1970, and 1971, she was the first woman to compete, unofficially.<br><br>
            In the winter of 1970, after failing to win a
            place on the first U.S. National Women's Nordic team to compete overseas, she
            began her marathon training early, often training on Harvard's indoor wooden
            track. That April, on a cold, rainy day, she ran the Boston Marathon in 3 hours,
            5 minutes and 7 seconds, 16 minutes better than any previous women racers, with
            a time not bettered untill 1974. In 1972, she and other women were finally able
            to run the Boston Marathon officially.<br><br>
            From 1976 to 1984, Sara Mae served four terms
            on the Cambridge School Committee, a period that oversaw the renovation and
            merging of the two Cambridge High Schools, approved a city-wide plan to avoid
            racial imbalance, and struggled to maintain educational quality in the face
            of Proposition 2-1/2.<br><br>
            
            Between
            1985 and 1999, she and Larry published <em>Orienteering North America</em>,
            a national magazine about the sport. In 1997, they began operating Berman's
            Orienteering Supply, a mail order business.<br>

        <p>
            Since
            1968, she has served as president of the Saul O Sidore Memorial Foundation,
            which honors her father. A main effort of the foundation has been to match grants
            with the University of New Hampshire for a series of annual lectures to raise
            critical and controversial issues facing society. The lectureships now extend
            to all the university branches. Continuing to be active in the Cambridge community,
            she has been a member of the Mid-Cambridge Neighborhood Association since its
            founding in 1975.

            Elizabeth Bishop was the daughter of Gertrude
            Bulmer and William Thomas Bishop, who owned the J.W. Bishop contracting firm
            in Worcester Massachusetts. Her father died before her first birthday and her mother was
            committed to a mental hospital by the time she was five years old. She was raised
            by maternal grandparents in Great Village, Nova Scotia. As a child she suffered
            from various physical and nervous ailments that made it difficult for her to
            walk and limited her early schooling. She went to boarding schools in Swampscott,
            and Natick where she contributed to the school newspapers. She attended Vassar
            College where, in addition to working for<em> The Vassar Miscellany</em>, the
            school newspaper, she was one of the founders of the Vassar literary magazine
            <em>Con Spirito</em> which endorsed socially conscious and avant-garde writing.
            Elizabeth's earliest work influenced by George Herbert and Gerard Manley Hopkins,
            appeared in the literary magazine she had founded. During this time, Bishop
            met the poet Marianne Moore, who became a close friend, and mentor, and who
            pointed her in the direction of poetry as a vocation. <br><br>
            Following her graduation, Bishop's first manuscript<em>
                North and South </em>was chosen for publication in August 1946. During this
            period, she met Robert Lowell who helped her secure the post of poetry consultant
            for the Library of Congress while she worked on her second book. She traveled
            through France, Spain, North Africa, Ireland and Italy, but made her home in
            New York and Key West. She traveled to Brazil in 1951, but forced to remain
            in Brazil because of illness, she met and fell in love with Lota de Macedo Soares,
            who became her friend and companion. During this period, she came under the
            spell of the landscapes and cultures of Brazil. <br><br>
            

            In 1954 Bishop published her second book <em>A
                Cold Spring,</em> which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1956. Her third book <em>Questions
                of Travel</em>, included her childhood experiences and her life in Brazil. After
            Soares committed suicide with an overdose of tranquilizers, Bishop returned
            to the United States. Bishop's book <em>Complete Poems</em>, was awarded
            the National Book Award in 1970. That year Bishop began to teach at Harvard
            University where she remained for seven years, also spending short stints at
            the University of Washington, New York University.
            <br><Br> Shortly before her death,
            she also taught at Massachusetts Institute for Technology. In 1976, Bishop became
            the first American and the first woman to be awarded the Books Abroad/Neustadt
            International Prize for Literature. That same year, Bishop published her final
            collection of poetry entitled <em>Geography III</em>, awarded the Book Critics
            Circle Award in 1977. In October of 1979, Bishop passed away at the age of sixty-eight,
            widely acclaimed as an important modern poet.

            Library and aimed to record the stories of women who had wide ranging impact in early 20th century America.
            Some
            women were professionals in education, government, the arts, business, medicine and law, and other women
            worked
            at home and volunteered locally, regionally and nationally. The interviews cover childhood, education,
            families,
            career and volunteer accomplishments and their experience as black women in society. The archive, housed at

            the next generation of Chinese scientists during difficult political times.
            <br><br>She retired to Cambridge in 1950 and lived near the home of her brother, the
            noted Harvard psychologist and professor, Edwin Boring. During her last years,
            she became active in Cambridge civic affairs.

        narrative: `
            Nadia Boulanger was born to a family of musicians in Paris. Her mother was the
            Russian princess, Raissa Myskatskaya, and her father was famed French musician,
            Ernest Boulanger. She entered the Paris Conservatory at the age of ten. She studied
            with renowned composers including Gabriel Faur&eacute;, whose work she promoted
            throughout her life. However, despite her considerable talent for composition,
            she felt overshadowed by her younger sister Lili, who at an early age won the
            Grand Prix de Rome (the first woman to do so). Lili died at the age of 24. Nadia
            then made the choice to be a teacher of composition for which she is best known
            today. <br><br>She was celebrated as a teacher at the American Conservatory at Fontainebleau,
            France. In her lifetime she taught such twentieth-century American composers
            as Leonard Bernstein, Elliot Carter, Aaron Copeland, Irving Fine, Philip Glass,
            Roy Harris, Daniel Pinkham, Walter Piston, Douglas Moore and Virgil Thomson,
            as well as many other performing musicians. As a teacher of twentieth-century
            composers, she was particularly inspired by the work of Stravinsky, and she conducted
            several premiers of his works in this country and Europe. <br><br>
            When the Second World War broke out in 1938, Boulanger joined
            Cambridge's
            Longy School of Music where she remained until 1945. In Cambridge and Boston
            she lectured on Beethoven string quartets and Bach cantatas. While teaching or
            conducting in Massachusetts, she resided at 30 Gerry's Landing on Coolidge
            Hill as the guest of J. Malcolm Forbes. In addition she stayed with her friend,
            Winifred Hope Johnstone, on Bay State Road in Boston. She was the first woman
            to conduct symphony orchestras in New York, Boston and Philadelphia. When she
            was not conducting workshops throughout the United States, she taught classes
            at Longy and also at Harvard University in harmony, score reading, counterpoint
            and solfege, until she returned to France. <br><br>As a musician, she possessed a perfect
            ear and a phenomenal memory. As a teacher, she is remembered for pushing her
            students to their limits. After she left the United States, Boulanger continued
            to demand utter dedication to music from those Americans who made the pilgrimage
            to the American Conservatory at Fontainebleau where she was named director in
            1950. <br><br>She died in Paris at the age of ninety-two in 1979.

        narrative: `

            Daughter of Dorothy (Yorke) and Thomas Dudley,
            of Northampton, England, Anne's parents believed in educating their daughters
            along as well as their sons, an unusual belief at the time. She had access to
            private tutors and the Earl of Lincoln's library on whose estate she grew
            up. Anne became fluent in Latin, and learned poetry, religion and natural science.
            She married Simon Bradstreet in 1628 at the age of sixteen. Her husband was
            assistant of the Massachusetts Bay Company which planned the emigration to New
            England. <br><br>Along with her parents, they joined the colonists headed by John Winthrop,
            future governor of the colony, they arrived in New England on Winthrop's
            flagship <em>Arabella</em>. Upon arrival, her father was named deputy governor
            of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The positions of her husband and father gave
            her a place of honor in the new colony. After a year in Charlestown, they moved
            to Cambridge around 1631, near what is now 1384 Massachusetts Avenue in the
            heart of Harvard Square. Her first child, Samuel, was born in Cambridge in 1633.
            They lived there for about five years before moving to Ipswich and later Andover.
           <br><br>Bradstreet reared eight children in all. Her procreative
            years were also a period of great poetic energy. Her most popular work included
            poems to and about family members, although she also wrote some formal elegies.
            One collection, <em>The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung up in America</em>, was published
            in her lifetime without her knowledge or consent (1650). This group of poems,
            published by her brother-in-law in England, had no references to the New World.
            A later, superior compilation, <em>Several Poems Compiled with a Great Variety
                of Wit and Learning</em>, appeared seven years after her death (1678) and included
            her response to the New England landscape, reflecting a Puritan view of life.

            Marilynn Brass is the daughter of Dorothy (Katziff)
            Brass and Harry Brass. Raised in a lively orthodox Jewish household in Winthrop,
            Massachusetts, she was influenced by the enthusiastic cooking of her mother and grandmother.
            As a young woman, she attended Northeastern University where she studied English
            and Journalism, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree <em>cum laude</em>
            and with Departmental Honors in English in 1964. <br><br>She went on to study English
            on a fellowship at Northeastern, receiving her Master of Arts degree in 1966.
            Moving to Cambridge the following year, she lived at the Cambridge YWCA where
            she served as a floor councilor and later became a member of the Y Personnel
            Committee. While there, she assisted in the planning and implementation of a
            Racism Workshop during the turbulent era of the Civil Rights movement. <br><br>
            
            When
            first in Cambridge, she worked at the Instrumentation Laboratory at MIT during
            the period when the laboratory was involved with the Apollo Project. When the
            inertial guidance and navigation laboratory was divested from MIT to become
            the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, she moved with it and created and ran the
            Public Communications and Community Affairs Office that dealt with two thousand
            local, national, and international employees.<br>
             More recently, she has worked as a consultant and employee
            for WGBH, within its How-Tos unit that produced programs including &#8220;This
            Old House,&#8221; &#8220;The Victory Garden,&#8221; and &#8220;The New Yankee
            Workshop.&#8221;<br><br>

            With her older sister, Sheila
                    Brass, she owns and runs Shelmar Antiques, which the sisters started
            when they left their jobs in 1975 to care for their ailing father. They have
            been licensed antique dealers for more than 40 years.<br>
            The sisters were the North American Consultants
            for Miller's Publications, in London, for 11 years. They were responsible
            for research, photo shoots, and marketing information for several of Miller's
            books on antiques and collectibles. Marilynn wrote the introduction to the first
            section on rare and collectible cookbooks for Miller's Publications, and
            with her sister, Sheila, were principals in writing and producing a comprehensive
            guide to kitchenware and culinary antiques.<br><br>
             The sisters have always been interested in old cookbooks,
            which gave them an insight into the history of domestic cooking. They began
            to collect both handwritten manuscript and printed cookbooks, culinary advertising
            and culinary antiques, menus, and food molds from all over the world, some dating
            from the seventeenth century. Their collections (which include 6,500 cookbooks)
            and their knowledge of culinary history have led to frequent speaking engagements
            at museums, libraries, and educational institutions throughout the country.<br>
             In 2006, they launched their first publication based
            on manuscript cookbooks, creating a new category of cookbook that translates
            heirloom recipes for the modern kitchen. This book, <em>Heirloom Baking with
                the Brass Sisters</em>, was one of three nominees for a James Beard Foundation
            Award in the Baking and Dessert category in 2007.<br><br>
             Their second book, <em>Heirloom Cooking with the Brass
                Sisters, Recipes You Remember and Love</em>, appeared in October 2008. Both
            this and the previous volume were selected by <em>Food &amp; Wine Magazine</em>
            to be noted among the 25 best cookbooks published in 2007 and 2009, and were
            included in the magazine's volumes <em>The Best of the Best 25 Cookbooks 2007
                and The Best of the Best 25 Cookbooks 2009</em>.<br><br>
             In 2008, the sisters appeared in their own television
            show, &#8220;The Brass Sisters: Queens of Comfort Food,&#8221; which was broadcast
            on WGBH, the Public Television Station in Boston. In 2011, they presented their
            one-hour special, The Brass Sisters Celebrate the Holidays, on the Cooking Channel.
            They were part of a select group to win a &#8220;Throwdown&#8221; with Chef
            Bobby Flay on the Food Network by baking their mother's recipe for Pineapple
            Upside-Down Cake.<br><br>
             With her sister, Sheila, she was honored by the City
            of Cambridge in 2016 when they were named &#8220;Cambridge Food Heroes.&#8221;<br><br>
             The Brass Sisters are presently working on a television
            series. They publish a blog offering memories of Cambridge along with delightful
            recipes.<br>

        show co-host who elevated heirloom recipes and amassed a valued collection of cookbooks.
        <p>The Brass sisters were lauded by the James Beard Foundation for their heirloom baking cookbook

            Bread and Roses was co-founded by Pat Hynes and Gill Gane. It opened its doors as a
            woman-owned business for &ldquo;women and their friends&rdquo; after five months of renovating a
            &ldquo;dank,
            dismal&rdquo; neighborhood bar. Except for the plumbing, women did all of the architectural design,
            electrical,
            carpentry, sheet rocking, plastering, and painting, with a backdrop of feminist and lesbian
            singers/songwriters
            playing at full-volume.<br><br>
            
            The name Bread and Roses was adopted from the demand of the
            women-led textile strikers in Lawrence, Massachusetts in 1912: &ldquo;We want bread and roses, too.&rdquo; The
            statement
            was a reflection that the goal of the strike was to ensure that workers could do more than meet basic needs
            .<br><br>
            The project was launched by selling shares of stock to 100 women investors, with the
            Women&rsquo;s Law Collective providing legal support. Instead of tips, Bread and Roses paid above minimum
            wage
            and chose to donate to a feminist cause each week, such as Rosie&rsquo;s Place, the first shelter in the
            country
            specifically for poor and homeless women. Every Sunday evening, leftover meals were given to the newly
            opened
            domestic violence shelter in Cambridge, Transition House. <br><br>
            Twice a month, individual women artists, many who had never shown their art
            publicly,
            were invited to exhibit their artwork. Radical feminist speakers and performers, like Andrea Dworkin and
            Mary
            Daly, novelists Tillie Olsen and Alice Walker, musicians Alix Dobkin and Willie Tyson electrified the space,
            as
            did scientists, and athletes. Once, a woman rushed in, saying, &ldquo;I just arrived from Ireland, and this
            is
            the first place I wanted to visit!&rdquo;
           <br><br> In 1978 the restaurant sold to young feminists who in turn
            opened another one named, Amaranth, which when sold again became Daddio&rsquo;s restaurant (to which a
            Cambridge
            city councilwoman quipped, &ldquo;Given its history, do you have to name it Daddio&rsquo;s?&rdquo;). The
            restaurant Oleana, owned by Executive Chef Ana Sortun, has occupied the space since 2001.

            middle-class African American children, named after the Wellesley College president
            Alice Freeman Palmer who had funded her education. Although originally intended
            to educate all county children, she soon began to emphasize secondary and junior
            college education. She met and married a Harvard graduate, Edward S. Brown,
            but the marriage lasted only five years.<br><br> Attracting funding and students throughout
            the country, Charlotte Hawkins Brown continued to return to Cambridge each summer
            to raise money for the Institute and to continue her studies at Harvard, Wellesley
            and Simmons colleges. As the Institute grew more famous, she traveled throughout
            the country to lecture on African American education and interracial cooperation
            and received a number of honorary degrees.

            Sara Thorp, daughter of a Wisconsin lumber baron,
            Joseph Thorp, married Ole Bull, a renowned Norwegian concert violinist, in 1870
            when he was sixty years old and she only twenty. The marriage took place over
            the objections of her father but with approval of her mother. A daughter, Olea,
            was born a year later and for a few years they lived in Madison in a house her
            father built for them. <br><br>Sara took an active role in Ole Bull's complicated
            

            financial affairs. The family moved to Cambridge and rented James Russell Lowell's
            house while they had a house built for them at 168 Brattle Street. After Ole's
            death, Sara wrote his biography, <em>Ole Bull: A Memoir</em>, which was published
            by Houghton-Mifflin in 1883. She was active in the cultural and social circles
            of Boston and Cambridge, and became a close companion of important figures including
            Julia Ward Howe, Annie Allegra Longfellow Thorp, daughter of the poet Henry
            Wadsworth Longfellow, who married her brother Joseph Gilbert Thorp, Alice Longfellow,

            figures for a series of lectures offered each spring and fall from 1896 through
            1899. She was also a charter member of the Cambridge Garden Club. In the later

            Bennington, Gaucher, Yale, and Wellesley. After the death of her husband in
            1954, she took an administrative position at Douglass College for Women, Rutgers
            University in 1955. She was named president of Radcliffe College in 1960 and
            held that position until 1973. As president, she made a number of significant
            changes at Radcliffe. During her tenure, Radcliffe students first received Harvard
            degrees, women were admitted to the graduate and business schools, and the Radcliffe
            Graduate School merged with Harvard's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
            <br><br>Bunting established the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study, initially
            designed to encourage the furthering of the careers of talented women who taken

            took a position as special assistant to the president of Princeton University,
            where she remained until 1975, guiding the university through its first years
            as a co-educational institution. <br><br>In 1979, she married for the second time to

        Gladys Marion Canada's father was Ambrose Canada, who was born 1882 in Tennessee.  Her mother was
         Ellen Louise Harvey (born in Virginia).  Gladys' grandfather Anthony Canada was born in 1851 in Virginia and being an
        African-American, this likely means he was born into slavery.  <Br><Br>

        By the early 1900s, Gladys' grandfather Anthony had moved to Cambridge and the
        family lived on Harvey St. in North Cambridge.  They later moved to North Woburn,
        where Gladys had her early schooling and she went on to attend the Boston Industrial
        Trade School in the early 1920s, where she excelled in sewing (the school in the North End still exists today). <Br><Br>

        In 1926, she married Frank R. Butler, who worked as a porter, and by 1941 they had
        moved into a house on Hubbard Ave. in North Cambridge. Gladys was a dedicated mother 
        to her two sons Paul and James and a devoted member of the Union Baptist Church (UBC) in Central
        Square for over 50 years, where she served on many committees.  
        UBC was founded in 1877 by African-Americans in Cambridge and Gladys was a 
        member of UBC when Martin Luther King, Jr. preached there in April of 1955.

    Four-time Iditarod Champion, Susan Butcher, was born and grew up in Cambridge. She attended The 
    Warehouse Cooperative School, an alternative school located in a vacated warehouse in an industrial 
    area in Roxbury.  She attributed her love of outdoor adventures to vacations spent in the Maine woods 
    during her childhood. Butcher studied to become a veterinary technician at Colorado State University. 
    She moved to Alaska in 1975, to pursue her passion for dogsled racing and to train for the Iditarod 
    Trail Sled Dog Race.<Br><Br>
    Butcher, who raced in her first Iditarod, a grueling 1,100 mile race from Anchorage to
    Nome, in 1978, finished in the top five from 1980 to 1984. In 1985, she was leading in the early
    stages of the race when a sick and dying moose blundered into her path on the trail. A few
    frantic minutes later, two of Butcher's dogs were dead, others were injured and she was out of
    the race. In 1986, she became the second woman to win the race. She added victories in 1987,
    1988, and 1990, and finished in the top four through 1993. Butcher finished in the top five in 12
    of her 17 attempts at the Iditarod from 1978 to 1994. Her success brought unprecedented
    attention to the race.<Br><Br>
    Butcher's careful training and treatment of her dogs revolutionized the sport. She raised
    and trained dogs with her husband at Trail Breakers Kennel near Fairbanks, Alaska. In a 1990
    interview with the Boston Globe, Butcher commented on her relationship with her sled dogs,
    "They used to say this race was one-third dog, one-third musher, and one-third luck, but I think
    I changed that. I am meticulous about training and caring for my dogs. They're everything - my
    friends, family, and co-workers. They are the athletes and are trained and chosen for
    competition just like any athlete."<Br><Br>
    In 1994, Butcher ran her last Iditarod, when she decided to have children. She had two
    daughters, Tekla and Chisana, with her husband, lawyer and musher, David Monson. She
    passed away in 2006, at age 51, in Seattle, WA, from leukemia. In 2008, the Alaska state
    legislature established Susan Butcher Day, to be observed on the first Saturday of March each
    year. Later that year, the University of Alaska at Fairbanks announced the creation of the Susan
    Butcher Institute, to develop public service and leadership skills among young Alaskans.

        Barbara Beckwith grew up in New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, moving to 
        Cambridge in 1965 where she enthusiastically took on the roles of activist, journalist, 
        teacher, and essayist.<br><Br>

        In the 1970s and 1980s, Barbara was involved in local fights for rent control, educational 
        access, withdrawal from the Vietnam War, women's liberation, ending the nuclear arms race, 
        social responsibility in science, and writers' rights.<br><Br>

        In the 1970s, she went door-to-door to advocate for rent control, and then to end the 
        Vietnam War. In the 1980s, alarmed by the nuclear arms buildup during President Reagan's 
        presidency, she and other Cambridge women formed an affinity group and participated in civil 
        disobedience at various sites, including at an arms marketing event at the Colonnade Hotel in
        Cambridge. Arrested twice for trespassing, she did community service, per a judge's orders.<br><Br>

        Barbara was committed to Cambridge's public schools, which her two sons attended. 
        She helped launch the Cambridge School Volunteers Program (museum kits and speakers programs) 
        and the city's after-school program. As education chair of the Civic Unity Committee, 
        she pressed for more Black teachers, library books, curriculum, and participated in the 
        hiring of Cambridge's first African American Superintendent of Schools, Alfonso Cheatham.
        As Clerk of the Cambridge Civic Association, she worked on progressive platforms.<br><Br>

        Starting in the 1970s, Barbara taught English for 12 years at Pilot School in Cambridge and Home Base in 
        Watertown, both alternative public high schools. She developed courses on subjects such 
        as <i>Real People</i> (interviewing), <i>Language and Power</i>, and <i>Assertiveness</i>.<br><Br>

        She worked with Cambridge-based non-profit FairTest to co-author <i>Standing Up to the SAT</i> 
        (ARCO, 1989), a critique of standardized tests. In the 1990s, she was active in Cambridge-based
        Educators for Social Responsibility, where she and other teachers developed teaching guides 
        on nuclear issues and concepts of peace. She served on the editorial board of Science for 
        the People, based in Central Square, and with her husband Jon, was active in its sociobiology
         study group.<br><Br>

        Barbara returned to college in her 40s to get a journalism degree, worked at the Middlesex 
        News and Brookline Chronicle, and then became a freelance writer (the Cambridge Chronicle published 
        her first feature article on Huron Ave women business owners.) She published articles and 
        essays in local, regional, national and movement/feminist newspapers, magazines, anthologies, 
        and radio. She was for many years a news editor and contributor to the Cambridge-based feminist
        journal, <i>Sojourner: the Women's Forum</i>.<br><Br>

        In the 1990s, she taught journalism as an adjunct professor at Framingham State College, 
        Suffolk University, and Emerson College, and led journalism, travel and essay writing workshops
        at the Cambridge Center for Adult Education. Barbara was a National Writers Union's activist
        and Boston Chapter Steering Committee member, serving three terms on the national executive
        board. In 1991, PEN New England awarded her their "Friend to Writers" award for organizing
            biennial "For Love AND Money" writers' conferences held at the John F Kennedy School of
            Government. She was also the union's Series Advisor for the <i>Writers Life</i> monthly speaker
            series at the Cambridge Center for Adult Education.<br><Br>

        As a member of the NWU national and local diversity committees, Barbara worked to prioritize 
        issues vital to writers of color, LGBTQ writers, and writers with disabilities. She built a 
        "Publishers and Editors Who Work with Writers of Color" database. She also worked with 100 
        writers to produce the union's <i>Building Strength Through Diversity</i> handbook (2002).<br><Br>

        The more Barbara became aware of the complexity of anti-Black racism, she determined to take 
        action in every sphere (institutional, interpersonal, individual) of her life. She joined 
        Community Change Inc's anti-racism library committee, and volunteered as a Gustavus Meyers 
        Awards book reviewer.<br><Br>

        In the 1990s, she worked to challenge institutional, cultural, and individual racism. In 2001,
        She became a co-facilitator of <i>"White People Challenging Racism: Moving from Talk to Action"</i> 
        workshops at the Cambridge Center for Adult Education, and co-led workshops or spoke at White
        Privilege conferences, at racial justice conferences in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and at
        Cambridge's Women's Explore lecture/discussion series.<br><Br>

        She compiled her personal essays that pondered racism and white privilege (including her own) 
        into a booklet series: <i>What Was I Thinking? Reflecting on Everyday Racism</i> (2009), <i>Digging Deeper
        into Everyday Racism</i> (2013) and <i>Questions and Quandaries</i> (2015).
        <br><Br>
        In her 80s, Barbara coached a Women's Writing Workshop for older women who live in Mission 
        Hill, Fenway, Jamaica Plain, Roxbury and Dorchester. The free workshop culminated in <i>From
         Our Notebooks: Essays, Stories, and Reflections booklets </i>(2017, 2019).<br><Br>

        When her husband was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2020, she wrote essays to explore her
        perspective on their experience, freely sharing her "Learning to Care" series with others facing
        caregiving challenges, at home and in memory care facilities.

        Betty Butterfield launched a fundraiser in 1959 for her
        alma mater, Bryn Mawr College, that became a nonprofit bookstore.<Br><Br>
        The Bryn Mawr Book Store remains in its original location at 373
        Huron Avenue in West Cambridge. All of the books are donated, the staff is all volunteer,
        and profits fund scholarships at the college.<Br><Br>
        Over the years the store has donated well over $2 million for scholarships.
        In an obituary for Elizabeth Butterfield, <i>The New York Times</i> wrote, "To
        raise money for scholarships for her alma mater, Mrs. Butterfield
        established a book sale that proved to be so successful that instead of
        having it once a year, it became a regular business, netting about $25,000
        (equivalent to $115,000 today) annually for scholarships. The money was
        raised by collecting books from attics and cellars, some of which sold for
        nickels and dimes and others that proved to be first editions of considerable
        value."<br><Br>
        Her husband, Lyman H. Butterfield, a historian knowledgeable about rare
        books, helped with the sorting and pricing of books in their basement.
        The first annual used book sale in Cambridge raised $1,800,
        equivalent to about $18,000 today. The sale became so popular that
        dealers lined up before the doors opened.<Br><Br>
        In 1971 Elizabeth Butterfield and other volunteers opened a bookstore. She
        and another volunteer subsequently bought the building. The bookstore
        bought it from them a few years later with the help of an interest-free loan.
        Originally called the Bryn Mawr Book Sale, the shop was re-named the
        Bryn Mawr Book Store in the 1980s. There once were nine Bryn Mawr

        used bookstores across the Northeast but the Cambridge store and The
        Lantern in Washington, D.C., are the only survivors.<Br><Br>
