            In 1985, The Back Porch Dance Company was founded
            as an interracial, intergenerational dance company with members whose ages
            ranged from over three generations. 
            
            <br><br>
            
            The directors, Joan Green and Vicki Solomon brought
            together a group of women and girls for a six-week workshop that evolved into
            the company. During its lifespan, the company included both professional and
            amateur dancers, including Ann Allen, Carol Strickland, Pat Zeigler, Lise
            Brody,
            Rebecca Lay, Tatoyia Foster, Vernell Foster, Lucy Wilson, Danita Callendar,
            Sandra Marcelino, Maggie Goncalves, Genii Guinier, Marcie Osinksy, Shirley
            Santos,
            Evelyn Tyner, Rhea Dunn, Sara Reese, Aislinn Macmaster, Dorothy Elizabeth Tucker,
            Euridece Spinola, Carol Ryser, Amy Gerson Stephanie Hope, Jen Schoonover,
            Sally
            DeAngelis, and Mariah Pisha. They had a space at 41 Second Street in Cambridge.
            
            <br><br>
            
            In May 2000, the company performed a piece of
            narrated dance theater at Kresge Auditorium, MIT, &#8220;Celebrating Cambridge
            Women and Work&#8221; honoring the diverse lives of eight working Cambridge
            women that included a curtain folder, biologist, homeless advocate, funeral

            home director, welder, library worker, MIT laboratory assistant, and psychiatrist.
            The oldest member of the company , World War II welder, Evelyn Tyner, eighty-two

            years old at the time, was one of the narrators.
            
            <br><br>
            
            Though the company had built
            a solid reputation and performed throughout New England, it dissolved in 2001,
            owing to changes in the lives of the directors. One of the directors, Joan
            Green, went on to teach elders and adults and to dance with the Elder Ensemble
            of Prometheus
            Dance Company, while the other director, Vicki Solomon, completed a Masters
            Degree in Library Science and began working full time in the Children's Room
            of the main branch of the Cambridge Public Library.

        narrative: `

            Born in Boston, the daughter of Francis V. and
            Ellen (Noyes) Balch, Emily Greene Balch attended private schools and then went
            to Bryn Mawr College, graduating in its first senior class in 1889. She went
            on to study sociology and went to Paris on a Bryn Mawr fellowship in 1890-1891
            to study economics with Emile Levasseur. As a result, she published her first
            book, <i>Public Assistance of the Poor in France</i> (1893).
            
            <br><br> 
            
            Balch returned
            to the U.S. to take courses at Harvard and the University of Chicago and spent
            a year studying economics in Berlin from 1895 to 1896. In 1896, she began to
            teach economics and sociology at Wellesley College and was named professor in
            1913. 
            
            <br><br>
            
            The February 10, 1900 Cambridge Chronicle highlighted her talk on "The Economics of Consumption."
            In 1913, the Cambridge Political Equality Association hosted a talk by Balch on "Brief 
            Jottings on Suffrage", where she told them:

            <blockquote>
            "The fact that woman does not count politically for a vote has a subtle and deep-reaching 
            effect on her economic status. The working woman and the poor woman need the vote for moral 
            as well as political reasons...The anti-suffragists admit equal suffrage is coming. It is 
            manifest destiny and is but the external evidence of a thing that is gradually accomplishing itself."
            </blockquote>
            
            She also was a member of state and municipal commissions studying immigration
            and education. Active in the women's suffrage movement, she also worked
            for racial justice and for improvement in labor conditions. She became interested
            in the situation of Slavic &#8211;Americans and traveled throughout the Austro-Hungarian
            Empire to areas from which they had migrated for a book on the topic that was
            
            published in 1910. Opposed to the First World War, she was fired from Wellesley
            at the beginning of that war for &#8220;teaching pacifism not economics.&#8221;
            
            <br><br>
            
            Balch began to serve as an editor of the liberal
            journal, the <i>Nation</i>, and attended the second International Congress
            of Women in 1919, held in Zurich. There she was designated secretary of the
            new organization Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF),
            headquartered in Geneva where she remained until 1922. (She would serve as unpaid
            secretary again in 1934-5, when the League fell on hard times). Balch continued
            to assist a variety of commissions and international groups, including working
            for the League of Nations on topics such as disarmament, aviation, and drug
            control. For WILPF, she studied conditions in Haiti, then occupied by U.S. marines,
            and edited and was the primary contributor for the report published as <i>Occupied
                Haiti </i>(1926) that was significant in causing the U.S. to withdraw.
                
                <br><br> 
                
                In the
            1930s, with the rise of facism and Nazism, she began to write about the victims
            of persecution. During the Second World War, she published a book of poetry
            and began to write on the need for future internationalization of aviation and
            waterways.
            
            <br><br>
            
            In 1946, Balch was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize
            for her work for peace and international cooperation. At seventy-nine and in
            frail health, she contributed the prize money awarded to her to WILPF, continuing
            to work with the organization in an honorary capacity. As late as 1949, she
            served as chair of a committee that honored the centenary of the sociologist
            Jane Addams, who had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931. 
            <br>
            <br>In 1957, on her 90th birthday, Balch was living at 8 Dana Street in Cambridge and was
             honored by the Cambridge Branch 
            of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom.

            Born in Cambridge to Mary E. (Blake) and Peter
            L. Baldwin, Maria Baldwin was educated in the Cambridge public schools, graduating
            

            from Cambridge High School in 1874. She graduated from Cambridge Teachers'
            Training School the following year.
            
            <br><br> 
            
            When she was unable to find a position in
            the Boston area, Baldwin began a teaching career in Charlestown, Maryland. In 1882,
            pressure from the Cambridge African American community resulted in the hiring

            of Baldwin as a primary school teacher at Agassiz Grammar School at 28 Sacramento
            Street. Seven years later, she was appointed principal of that school, the first
            black woman to be appointed as a principal in Massachusetts. In 1899, she was living at 
            196 Prospect Street. 

            <br><br>
            
            In August of 1915, The Crisis magazine ran an essay by her, where she stated:
            
            <blockquote>
            "The profession of teaching has a rich inheritance. These convictions were bequeathed 
            to it, to have and to hold: that the dearest interests of life are in its keeping; that 
            its peculiar service to society is to nourish and perpetuate those noblest aspirations 
            called its ideals ; that to do such work one must be devoted and unselfish."
            
            </blockquote>
            In 1916,
            when a new, larger school building was built, she was appointed master of the Aggasiz.
            
            <br><br>
            
            Always interested in new learning, she took many courses at Harvard and other
            schools throughout her life. She corresponded and worked with many men and women
            of distinction in the area. She also taught during the summer at Hampton Institute
            in Virginia and the Institute for Colored Youth in Cheyney, PA. The Agassiz
            school in Cambridge was rebuilt in 1995 and on May 21st, 2002, the Cambridge
            School Committee unanimously voted to rename the Agassiz School to the Maria
            L. Baldwin School in her honor.

            Born a slave, Louisa was given the name Mary Frances Melburn as a child which
            she changed to Louisa Jones when she fled to freedom. As a child, she grew up
            in a household in Hampton, Virginia, but was sold as a child to Captain Chapman
            who ran a steamboat line in that state. She was moved to Norfolk and then, as
            a young woman, bounded out to learn dressmaking until she was twenty-four.

            In
            1857, being suspected of aiding slaves to escape to Philadelphia, she fled by
            traveling on a steamboat, disguised as a wealthy young Southerner. 
            When she reached Philadelphia, she found a reward
            being offered for her capture, which prompted her to change her name. She continued
            on to Boston, helped by friendly abolitionists. There in Boston, the story of
            her escape became known, and she was found a position as a dressmaker. Louisa
            continued to actively aid the abolitionist movement and abolitionists including
            Wendell Phillips and Charles Sumner. She knew from her first-hand experience
            the successful methods for escape.

            In 1864, she married Archer H. Barlow, also
            an escaped slave. The couple moved to Cambridge around 1870 and set up house
            at 168 Elm Street in Cambridgeport. An active member of the Twelfth Street Baptist
            Church in Boston and various women's benevolent organizations, she died
            at the age of sixty- three. Her funeral was attended by representatives of the
            abolitionist families who had supported her as well as by the Black community.

            Mary Bancroft, author and intelligence officer
            for the Office of Strategic Services, was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1903
            to Mary Agnes (Cogan) and Hugh Bancroft, later publisher of <i>The Wall Street
                Journal</i>. Her mother, who studied at Radcliffe College, died soon after
            Mary was born. As a child, Bancroft lived at 12 Ware Street and went to the Winsor School, in Boston
            in 1921. She entered Smith College in 1922, but left college after three months,
            and soon after married Sherwin Badger, figure skating champion, who had graduated
            from Harvard College and then took a position with the United Fruit Company.
            The young couple spent a year in Cuba. They had three children: two sons, one
            who died in infancy, and a daughter. The couple divorced in 1932. 
            
            <br><br>
            
            In 1935, she married Jean Rufenacht, a Swiss businessman,
            and later moved to Zurich, where she was analyzed by and studied with C.G. Jung.
            Psychology became one of her life-long interests. With this background and her
            

            proficiency in French and German, she was hired by the Office of Strategic Services
            during the Second World War to work with Allen Dulles, whose lover she was briefly.
            As an agent, she analyzed speeches and writings of Nazi leaders, and wrote reports
            on conversations with German contacts, including Hans Bernd Gisevius, a German
            envoy to Switzerland who was involved in the early plots against Hitler. After
            the war, she divorced her Swiss husband in 1947, and then worked as a freelance
            journalist and translator. She returned to America in 1953, settling in New
            York City, where she lectured professionally and wrote novels, including <i>Upside
            Down in the Magnolia Tree</i> (1952), and <i>The Inseparables</i> (1958).

            <blockquote>
            "This is a deliciously nostalgic book about a little girl, Kathy (Mrs. Bancroft),
            growing up in Cambridge in the early 1900's. It was the days of the late Victorian
            houses, or the iron deer on the lawn, the buttons and bows and the long ribbed 
            stockings, and the time of the Sunday breakfast and fishballs, based beans and 
            doughnuts."<br>
            - <i>May 1952 review in the Cambridge Chronicle of Bancroft's new book "Upside Down in the Magnolia Tree."</i>
            </blockquote>

            She continued to work as a translator and publish book reviews. In 1983, she
            published a memoir, <i>Autobiography of a Spy</i>. 
            
            <br><br>
            
            Bancroft became involved in Democratic politics,
            working on various campaigns. She continued her interest in Jungian psychology
            through her correspondence and membership in the Analytical Psychology Club
            of New York and the Jung Foundation and sat on the editorial board of <i>Psychological
                Perspectives</i> as consultant and book reviewer. She died in Manhattan on
            January 10, 1997. Her papers were given to the Schlesinger library.

            Charlotte Fiske Bates was born in New York City.
            Her father, Harvey Bates, died in her infancy, and from the time she was nine
            she lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She was educated in the public schools
            of Cambridge and began to write poetry when quite young.

            For the first twenty-five
            years of her life she taught in private schools. She offered private instruction
            from her own home at 10 Ellery Street in the 1860s. Bates corresponded with
            Henry Wadsworth Longfellow from 1866 to 1882 and assisted Longfellow in compiling
            

            <i>Poems of Places</i> in a series of small volumes between 1875 and 1878,
            making ten translations for the work. She also edited the <i>Longfellow Birthday-Book</i>.
            She is best known for <i>The Seven Voices of Sympathy</i> (1881) a compilation
            of Longfellow's prose and poetry. She issued a selection of poems from English
            and American authors in the <i>Cambridge Book of Poetry and Song</i> (1882).

            although she kept her ties to Cambridge. In 1891 she married a Frenchman, Adolphe
            Rog&eacute;, who died five years later. She organized and read at a Longfellow
            memorial meeting at Sanders theater that raised money for the Longfellow fund.
            Some of her poetry was set to music by different American composers.

            De Ama Battle was born in the &#8220;Gold Coast&#8221;
            region of Cambridge (near Western Avenue) to James and Madge Haynes. She grew
            up in Davis Square, Somerville. By the time she was nine, DeAma developed into
            an artist whose medium was dance. Ethel Covan served as her &#8220;stage mother&#8221;
            and mentor which enabled her to study, perform and then teach with the Covanettes
            Dance Company. From the age of 14, De Ama acted as choreographer, arranged the
            childrens' performances at their yearly recital at John Hancock Hall,
            Boston. 
            
            <br><br>

            She pursued further study of dance at the Elma Lewis School of Fine Arts and
            with Chuck Davis, director of the African American Dance Ensemble. Beginning
            in 1972, Battle began a series of trips to West Africa, Brazil, and Jamaica
            to study, lecture and perform. She helped found one of the first Pan African
            dance companies.
            
            <br><br>
            
            She has taught African-rooted dance forms at Tufts
            University, Wellesley College and the Boston Conservatory and has run a performance
            group for teens. In 1975, De Ama Battle founded the Art of Black Dance &amp;
            Music, a dynamic performance troupe comprising as many as twenty dancers and
            musicians. Under the musical direction of Bamedele Osumarea they developed,
            explored and disseminated an extended concept of African dance. Committed to
            the philosophy and goals of arts education as an essential part of school curricula,
            she has performed in Cambridge schools through the artist-in-residency program.
            She also holds a Masters' degree in Education from Cambridge College.
            
            <br><br>

            De Ama Battle has received a series of awards
            and recognition including the Elliot Norton award in 1992 for &#8220;bringing
            the heartbeat of Africa and the Carribean Islands to Boston.&#8221; In 1995,
            she was recognized with the Commonwealth award for her outstanding contribution
            to the arts of Massachusetts and in 1996, she was awarded an honorary degree
            in humane letters from Mount Ida College of Newton, Massachusetts. In 2006, De Ama Battle
            received the Boston Dance Alliance Lifetime Achievement award.

            Founded in 1861, The Bee, originally called the
            &#8220;Banks Brigade&#8221; (in honor of the Civil War general Nathaniel Banks
            of Massachusetts), was a social and philanthropic group of young women from
            Cambridge formed for the purpose of sewing bandages, shirts, and knitting socks
            for the Union troops during the Civil War.

            Alice James was one of the early
            members. The organization was re-formed to sew bandages and uniforms for soldiers
            during the Spanish-American War and World War I. In 1918, they participated
            in a patriotic parade through the streets of Cambridge to help raise money for
            Liberty Loans. Concerned with health care, The Bee also raised money and helped
            design a children's solarium in the children's ward for the Cambridge
            Hospital.<br><br>

            In 1924, Mary Towle Palmer, who had been a member, wrote an account of their work, in

            <blockquote>
            "Wherever in our walks [in Cambridge] we saw a United States flag flying, we saluted it
             like true soldiers.<br><br>

            "We sometimes passed the old arsenal which stood on the corner of Garden and Follen Streets,
             where a house of singularly beautiful brown stone now stands surrounded by its large garden. 
             There we would stop and peer through the fence to watch the evolutions of the Harvard students
              who lived there in squads and were armed by the State and were regularly drilled...Our brothers 
              and cousins were there and might some day become full-fledged soldiers."

        narrative: `
            Mabel Hubbard grew up in Cambridge, at 148 Brattle
            Street. Before her fifth birthday, Mabel was stricken with scarlet fever and, as a result, became permanently deaf
            and with impaired balance. Because of her condition, her father worked to found
            the Clarke School for the Deaf (the first of its kind in America) in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, which Mabel attended. 
            
            
            <br><br>

            Mabel went to Germany in her teens to study
            chemistry and the German language and then returned to Cambridge at the age of sixteen. 
            By then she had learned to both lip-read and to speak (despite her deafness), one of the 
            first deaf childen in America to be able to do so (she also learned to lip-read and speak in multiple languages).
            
            <br><br>

            Alexander Graham Bell had taught at the Clarke School and later became a private tutor to Mabel, leading to 
            Mabel and Alexander becaming
            romantically involved. At first her parents opposed the marriage objecting
            to the age disparity (she was 19, he 29) and fearing that their children would be deaf (since Bell's
            mother was congenitally deaf), but the two were engaged in 1875 and married in 1877. 
            They had two sons who died in infancy and two daughters who
            lived into adulthood.
            
            <br><br>
            
            Around 1885, Mabel Bell helped establish the Young Ladies Club of Baddeck, one of the first Canadian women's 
            clubs, after
            visiting and falling in love with the Nova Scotia landscape.
            Bell was apparently known for her ability to make people comfortable with her deafness, helped by the fact that
            she was a master lipreader.
            
            <blockquote>“Mabel would host dinner 
            parties and situate herself at a spot around the table where she knew the light would shine better 
            on the faces of her guests, allowing her to better read their lips as they spoke.”</blockquote>

            In 1910, Mabel
            became a strong supporter of women's rights and marched in the women's
            suffrage national convention in Washington in 1910. During World War I, she
            sponsored benefits to raise money for the Red Cross and fund lifeboats for the
            US Navy. She later founded the Montessori Education Association and became its
            president. She also opened a school in Washington, D.C. and started the magazine of the Montessori Education 
            Association,
            <i>Freedom for the Child</i>.
            
            <br><br>
            
            After her husband's death in 1922, she began to go blind and 
            died on January 3, 1923 in Washington D.C. and was buried on Cape Breton Island,
            Nova Scotia, where the Bells had a summer home. Many of her letters to
            and from her husband are in the Bell Family Papers in the Library of Congress.

        narrative: `

            Satyra (Pearson) Bennett was one of four children
            of Frances Lavina (Gale) and William B.
            Pearson; their father was for many years pastor of St. Paul African Methodist
            Episcopal Church in Cambridge.
            
            <br><br>
            
            Satyra was born in 1892 in Rock Hill, Jamaica, and arrived in Worcester,
            Massachusetts, in 1903. After the family moved to Cambridge, she graduated from
            Cambridge Latin
            School, and in 1913 from Wilberforce University in Ohio. Satyra then taught at
            McKinley Institute in Lynchburg, Virginia, before her marriage in 1919 to Cyril
            George Bennett.
            Their son, George Barrett Bennett, was born a year later. She returned to Massachusetts
            and for more than thirty years worked as a linotype operator for a number of
            newspapers in the Boston area, living at 26 Mead Street in Cambridge.
            
            <br><br>
            Bennett was a constant presence in the life of the City of Cambridge. Her name appears in local papers
             117 times from 1919 to 1977.<br><Br>
            In the early 1920s, Bennett advertised her services in dress-making ("Misses' and Children's Dresses a Specialty").
            <br>

      
            1930 was a busy year for Bennet. That year, she was on the "Negro Committee" for the International 
            Festival, which was the finale to the celebration of the 300th anniversary of the founding of 
            Massachusetts, to take place in Cambridge at Memorial Hall.  She was also on the board of directors
             of the Cambridge Cosmopolitan Civic league formed "for the sole purpose of bettering the welfare
              of the community." And in December of 1930, she served as financial secretary on the executive 
              committee for that same group. A <i>Cambridge Tribune</i> article, entitled "RACIAL GROUPS IN
               CITY ORGANIZE FOR GENERAL WELFARE," displayed the preamble to the group's constitution:

            <blockquote>
            "We, the racial groups of the city of Cambridge, in order to insure the general welfare of the 
            community, to promote cooperation, understanding and good-will, do ordain and establish this
             association."
            </blockquote>

            Bennett was a consistent presence in Cambridge affairs for much of her life:
            <br>
            In 1937, Bennett headed a committee that organized an international festival at St. Paul's A.M.E.
             church, featuring "...native speakers from Africa, America, England, and India."
            <br>

      
            In 1942, she is mentioned as the superintendent of the church school at St. Paul's.
            <br>

      
            In 1953, Bennett served as a trustee for the Massachusetts Chapter of the Rheumatism and 
            Arthritis Foundation.
            <br>

      
            In 1954, she was on the membership committee for the Cambridge division of the NAACP.
            <br>

      
            In 1955, she was on the Cambridge Community Center committee sponsoring a moonlight dance and
             cruise in Boston Harbor.
            <br>

      
            In 1967, Bennett was honored at St. Paul's and...
            <blockquote>
            "A testimonial was given...by friends, well-wishers, and members of her church. Mrs. Bennett,
             a long time resident of Cambridge, attended its public schools, was graduated from Wilberforce 
             University and took special courses at Harvard. [A Mrs. Tinsely] paid a unique tribute using each 
             of the letters of Mrs. Bennett's first name "Satyra" and designating a meaning to each: "S" was 
             used for "service"...ending with "A" which stood for "activities" in so many of which Mrs. Bennett
              has taken part."
              </blockquote>

            A member of St. Paul AME Church for over seventy
            years, Satyra served as treasurer, trustee, superintendent of the Sunday School,
            and member of the Board of Christian
            Education. She was co-founder (1949) and president of the Citizens' Charitable
            Health Association, co-founder of the Cambridge Community Center, trustee of
            the Massachusetts chapter of the Arthritis Foundation, and vice-president of
            the Boston chapter of the NAACP. After suffering a series of strokes, she was
            cared for by her sister Ozeline (Pearson) Wise until her death in June
            1977.

             The
            daughter of Saul and May Sidore, who owned a knitting factory in Manchester,
            New Hampshire, Sara Mae was the eldest of five children. She married Larry Berman in 1955
            and attended the Rhode Island School of Design, graduating in 1958 with a BFA
            in Interior Design. The couple moved to Cambridge in 1958, following her graduation,
            and had three children. They currently have six grandchildren.
            
            <br><br>

            Sara Mae and Larry founded the Cambridge Sports
            Union in 1962, the first competitive sports club in New England for men and
            women. The club includes
            competitive running, cross-country skiing, orienteering (a sport which combines
            cross country running or cross country skiing and land navigation), also, recently,
            race-walking.
            
            <br><br>

            By 1964, under Larry's coaching, she had become a serious athlete in both running
            and cross country skiing and was living at 23 Fayette Street in Cambridge. (In 1968-69, she 
            was named to the first U.S. Women's
            National Nordic Team.) To build up her long distance, she ran, often unofficially,
            in men's road races. (The male runners welcomed her.) She and Larry decided
            to prepare her for running the Boston Marathon, although entry was still unofficial
            for women. In 1969, 1970, and 1971, she was the first woman to compete, unofficially.
            
            <br><br>
            
            In the winter of 1970, after failing to win a
            place on the first U.S. National Women's Nordic team to compete overseas, she
            began her marathon training early, often training on Harvard's indoor wooden
            track. That April, on a cold, rainy day, she ran the Boston Marathon in 3 hours,
            5 minutes and 7 seconds, 16 minutes better than any previous women racers, with
            a time not bettered untill 1974. In 1972, she and other women were finally able
            to run the Boston Marathon officially.
            
            <br><br>

            From 1976 to 1984, Sara Mae served four terms
            on the Cambridge School Committee, a period that oversaw the renovation and
            merging of the two Cambridge High Schools, approved a city-wide plan to avoid
            racial imbalance, and struggled to maintain educational quality in the face
            of Proposition 2-1/2.
            
            <br><br>
            
            Between 1985 and 1999, she and Larry published <i>Orienteering North America</i>,
            a national magazine about the sport. In 1997, they began operating Berman's
            Orienteering Supply, a mail order business.
            
            <br><br>
            
            Since 1968, she has served as president of the Saul O Sidore Memorial Foundation,
            which honors her father. A main effort of the foundation has been to match grants
            with the University of New Hampshire for a series of annual lectures to raise
            critical and controversial issues facing society. The lectureships now extend
            to all the university branches. Continuing to be active in the Cambridge community,
            she has been a member of the Mid-Cambridge Neighborhood Association since its
            founding in 1975.

            Daughter of Doris E Fleischman and Edward Bernays,
            Anne Bernays grew up on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in the household of
            a well-to-do Jewish family of some note. Her father was the &#8220;father of
            public relations&#8221; and a nephew of Sigmund Freud. As a child, she went
            to the prestigious girl's school, Brearley School and then went on to
            Wellesley College for two years (1948-1950), finishing her education as an English
            major at Barnard College graduating in 1952.
            
            <br><br> 

            She entered publishing until, in
            1954, she met and married Justin Kaplan. The couple moved to Cambridge in 1959
            where she wrote the first of her novels while raising her family.
            
            <br><br>
            
            Among the
            best known of her novels are <i>Growing up Rich</i> (1975) and <i>Professor
                Romeo</i> (1989). 
                
                In a 1968 talk to Radcliffe Phi Beta Kappa, Bernays reflected on life and work and writing:
           
                <blockquote>
            "in order to pursue your work you must be willing to let other things go, things generally
            associated with 'wife' and 'mother'...You cannot have it both ways. YOu cannot be all things 
            to all people. If you can create in one area with enough skill, passion, and compassion to 
            satisfy yourself, then you must be satisfied with partial success in other places...
            
            <br><br>

            "A woman writer does not want to let on that she is capable of the kind of emotional excess 
            that good strong fictional characters generally exhibit."
            </blockquote>


                In recent years she has joined her husband (noted for his
            biographies of Mark Twain, Lincoln Steffens, and Walt Whitman ) in writing two
            books, one on the manner in which names have changed, <i>The Language of Names</i>
            (1997) and another, a double memoir, <i>Back Then: Two Lives in 1950s New York
            </i>(2002). She published a new novel <i>Trophy House</i> in 2005 and is
            currently teaching at the Nieman Foundation, Harvard University. 
            
            <br><br>
            
            She has three
            daughters and six grandchildren.

            Elizabeth Bishop was the daughter of Gertrude
            Bulmer and William Thomas Bishop, who owned the J.W. Bishop contracting firm
            in Worcester Massachusetts. Her father died before her first birthday and her mother was
            committed to a mental hospital by the time she was five years old. She was raised
            by maternal grandparents in Great Village, Nova Scotia. As a child she suffered
            from various physical and nervous ailments that made it difficult for her to
            walk and limited her early schooling. She went to boarding schools in Swampscott,
            and Natick where she contributed to the school newspapers. 
            
            <br><br>
            
            She attended Vassar
            College where, in addition to working for<i> The Vassar Miscellany</i>, the
            school newspaper, she was one of the founders of the Vassar literary magazine
            <i>Con Spirito</i> which endorsed socially conscious and avant-garde writing.
            Elizabeth's earliest work influenced by George Herbert and Gerard Manley Hopkins,
            appeared in the literary magazine she had founded. During this time, Bishop
            met the poet Marianne Moore, who became a close friend, and mentor, and who
            pointed her in the direction of poetry as a vocation. 
            
            <br><br>

            Following her graduation, Bishop's first manuscript<i>
                North and South </i>was chosen for publication in August 1946. During this
            period, she met Robert Lowell who helped her secure the post of poetry consultant
            for the Library of Congress while she worked on her second book. She traveled
            through France, Spain, North Africa, Ireland and Italy, but made her home in
            New York and Key West. She traveled to Brazil in 1951, but forced to remain
            in Brazil because of illness, she met and fell in love with Lota de Macedo Soares,
            who became her friend and companion. During this period, she came under the
            spell of the landscapes and cultures of Brazil. 
            
            <br><br>
            

            In 1954 Bishop published her second book <i>A
                Cold Spring,</i> which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1956. Her third book <i>Questions
                of Travel</i>, included her childhood experiences and her life in Brazil. After
            Soares committed suicide with an overdose of tranquilizers, Bishop returned
            to the United States. Bishop's book <i>Complete Poems</i>, was awarded
            the National Book Award in 1970. That year Bishop began to teach at Harvard
            University where she remained for seven years, also spending short stints at
            the University of Washington, New York University.
            
            <br><br> 
            
            Shortly before her death,
            she also taught at Massachusetts Institute for Technology. In 1976, Bishop became
            the first American and the first woman to be awarded the Books Abroad/Neustadt
            International Prize for Literature. That same year, Bishop published her final
            collection of poetry entitled <i>Geography III</i>, awarded the Book Critics
            Circle Award in 1977. In October of 1979, Bishop passed away at the age of sixty-eight,
            widely acclaimed as an important modern poet.

            Beginning in the 1970s in Cambridge, oral histories became a community organizing
            tool.
            
            The Black Women&rsquo;s Oral History Project, like the Oral History Center, highlighted the importance of
            communicating across identities and documenting everyday people. The Black Women&rsquo;s Oral History
            Project included interviews with 72 African American women from Cambridge.
            
            <br><br>
            
            The project was supported by the
            Schlesinger
            Library and aimed to record the stories of women who had wide ranging impact in early 20th century America.
            Some women were professionals in education, government, the arts, business, medicine and law, and other women
            worked at home and volunteered locally, regionally and nationally. The interviews cover childhood, education,
            families,
            career and volunteer accomplishments and their experience as black women in society. The archive, housed at
            the Schlesinger Library, includes transcripts, biographies and photographs, all accessible online.

            The daughter of the renowned suffragist, Lucy
            Stone and her husband Henry Browne Blackwell, Alice Stone Blackwell moved with
            her family from New Jersey to Boston at the age of ten and studied in a number
            of local schools, graduating from Boston University in 1881. She immediately
            began to work in the offices of the
            paper established by her mother, the <i>Woman's Journal</i> with which
            she was connected until the beginning of World War I.
            
            <br><br> 
            
            From 1887-1905, she edited
            and distributed the <i>Woman's Column</i>, a periodical collection of
            suffrage news articles. She was also a founder of the Massachusetts League of
            Women Voters. She was a champion of women's rights for many years as well
            as at one time an associate editor of <i>Ladies Home Journal</i>. She was
            involved with the National American Women's Suffrage Association, Women's
            Christian Temperance Union, the Women's Trade Union League, the National
            Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and the American Peace Society.
            She sat on the board of Boston University and fought to end racial discrimination
            there. She was interested in the causes of other oppressed peoples, and supported
            Armenian and Russian protestors. She translated and published several volumes
            of the verses of Armenian, Yiddish, Russian, Hungarian, and Mexican poets. .She
            was active in the protests surrounding the case of Sacco and Vanzetti in the
            1920s. In 1930, she published a biography of her mother entitled: <i>Lucy Stone,
                Pioneer in Women's Rights. </i>
                
                <br><br>
                
                Although she spent much of her life in
            Dorchester, she moved to 1010 Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge in 
            1936, where she lived until her death fourteen years later.

            Born in upstate New York in a tuberculosis sanatorium,
            Mary Anne was adopted at the age of six months by Gertrude and Edric Weld, and
            grew up in Plymouth New Hampshire. She attended the Windsor School in Boston
            and then Smith College where she was active in the International Student Movement.
            In her junior year, which she spent abroad in Geneva Switzerland, she met and
            later married a Danish writer, Neils Mogens Bodecker who was then living in
            Paris. The couple moved to Manhattan, New York, and had three sons. In 1962,
            she divorced her husband and ten years later, moved to Massachusetts. She lived
            in Concord for more than a decade, then moved to Cambridge.
            
            <br><br>

            At the age of fifty one, she returned to graduate
            school to work towards a clinical social work master's degree at Boston
            University School of Social Work, which she completed in 1981. She did not cease
            her studies then, but, as a long time practitioner of Buddhist meditation, she
            went on to complete a certificate in advanced theological studies from the Episcopal
            Divinity School in Cambridge in 2001. 
            
            <br><br>

            
            Mary Anne Bodecker was motivated to work with
            women with AIDS by the illness of her middle son, Torsten, who contracted the
            disease in the early 1980s, and then dedicated himself to work on behalf of
            HIV programs. He died in 1992. She set up the first case management program
            in the country to work with incarcerated women with AIDS at the Massachusetts
            State Prison for Women at Framingham and then helped to found a home for formerly
            homeless women with HIV/AIDS in 1990 at Rush House.
            
            <br><br>

            Bodecker's caring and compassion come through in a 1989 article about the Women and AIDS Project:
            
            <blockquote>
            "The prison sends most women out with no after-care plans," says Bodecker, and the project 
            is working to change that. Bodecker worked closely with Maria Lopez during her last eight
             months in prison, and as the date of her parole approached, she collaborated on postrelease
              plans with a caseworker from Lopez's hometown, arranging for a weekly visiting nurse and 
              scoping out AIDS and drug support groups in the area."
            </blockquote>
        
            
            For more than five years,
            she was a social worker in the AIDS Clinic at Cambridge Hospital.
            To understand the world wide impact of the disease, she traveled to AIDS clinics
            in Nepal and India and then to South Africa.
            
            <br><br>

            Her travels began to include nature treks as well,
            to Quebec to see baby seals and then to Labrador and Newfoundland to study polar
            bears and snowy owls, She also traveled to Antarctica to view the penguin colonies.
            When almost seventy, she took a dog sledding trip to Alaska, camping in deep
            snow. Her yearly accounts of her travels always included her response to social
            injustice throughout the world. She died in Cambridge on her seventy-eighth
            birthday.

            Ann Keefe was born in Boston on December 3, 1939,
            the daughter of Irish immigrants. She grew up in Cambridge and graduated from
            Matignon High School. She married Frank Bolger ca. 1960.

            Paul Street, near City Hall). The
            Parent Liason positions, now a universal feature of Cambridge schools, are based
            on the job she created. Her work is nationally recognized as a model for family
            involvement in schools. She developed a system for forming well-balanced classrooms,
            she created an admissions policy for CAPS, a complex process looking at race,
            gender, and income. She served 21 years on the board of Cambridge School Volunteers.
            For 5 years she was a member of the School Health Task Force, successfully lobbying
            for additional school nurses and for a comprehensive health policy for the schools.

            Alice Boring was born to Elizabeth and Edwin Boring
            and educated at Bryn Mawr where she obtained both undergraduate (B. A. 1904)
            and graduate degrees (M.A. 1905, Ph.D. 1910).

            She studied genetics with Thomas
            Hunt Morgan and Nettie Stevens and in the summers, regularly worked at the Oceanographic
            Institute at Woods Hole in Massachusetts. She taught at the University of Pennsylvania
            while working on her PhD and then, briefly at Vassar. After obtaining her degree
            she went to the University of Maine where she rose from instructor to associate
            professor by 1913 where she remained until 1918, teaching and publishing on
            genetics. In that year, she went as a visiting professor to the Peking Union
            Medical College in China. This was to have a major impact on her life.

            but chose to return to China in 1923. She remained there for the rest of her
            professional life as professor of biology at Yenching University, educating
            the next generation of Chinese scientists during difficult political times.

        narrative: `
            Nadia Boulanger was born to a family of musicians in Paris. Her mother was the
            Russian princess, Raissa Myskatskaya, and her father was famed French musician,
            Ernest Boulanger. She entered the Paris Conservatory at the age of ten. She studied
            with renowned composers including Gabriel Faur&eacute;, whose work she promoted
            throughout her life. However, despite her considerable talent for composition,
            she felt overshadowed by her younger sister Lili, who at an early age won the
            Grand Prix de Rome (the first woman to do so). Lili died at the age of 24. Nadia
            then made the choice to be a teacher of composition for which she is best known
            today. 
            
            <br><br>
            
            She was celebrated as a teacher at the American Conservatory at Fontainebleau,
            France. In her lifetime she taught such twentieth-century American composers
            as Leonard Bernstein, Elliot Carter, Aaron Copeland, Irving Fine, Philip Glass,
            Roy Harris, Daniel Pinkham, Walter Piston, Douglas Moore and Virgil Thomson,
            as well as many other performing musicians. As a teacher of twentieth-century
            composers, she was particularly inspired by the work of Stravinsky, and she conducted
            several premiers of his works in this country and Europe. 
            
            <br><br>

            When the Second World War broke out in 1938, Boulanger joined
            Cambridge's
            Longy School of Music where she remained until 1945 (she was living at Gerry's Landing Road).
             In Cambridge and Boston
            she lectured on Beethoven string quartets and Bach cantatas. While teaching or
            conducting in Massachusetts, she resided at 30 Gerry's Landing on Coolidge
            Hill as the guest of J. Malcolm Forbes. In addition she stayed with her friend,
            Winifred Hope Johnstone, on Bay State Road in Boston. She was the first woman
            to conduct symphony orchestras in New York, Boston and Philadelphia. When she
            was not conducting workshops throughout the United States, she taught classes
            at Longy and also at Harvard University in harmony, score reading, counterpoint
            and solfege, until she returned to France. 
            
            <br><br>
            
            As a musician, she possessed a perfect
            ear and a phenomenal memory. As a teacher, she is remembered for pushing her
            students to their limits. After she left the United States, Boulanger continued
            to demand utter dedication to music from those Americans who made the pilgrimage
            to the American Conservatory at Fontainebleau where she was named director in
            1950. 
            
            <br><br>
            
            She died in Paris at the age of ninety-two in 1979.

        narrative: `

            Daughter of Dorothy (Yorke) and Thomas Dudley,
            of Northampton, England, Anne's parents believed in educating their daughters
            along as well as their sons, an unusual belief at the time. She had access to
            private tutors and the Earl of Lincoln's library on whose estate she grew
            up. Anne became fluent in Latin, and learned poetry, religion and natural science.
            She married Simon Bradstreet in 1628 at the age of sixteen. Her husband was
            assistant of the Massachusetts Bay Company which planned the emigration to New
            England. 
            
            <br><br>
            
            Along with her parents, they joined the colonists headed by John Winthrop,
            future governor of the colony, they arrived in New England on Winthrop's
            flagship <i>Arabella</i>. Upon arrival, her father was named deputy governor
            of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The positions of her husband and father gave
            her a place of honor in the new colony. After a year in Charlestown, they moved
            to Cambridge around 1631, near what is now 1384 Massachusetts Avenue in the
            heart of Harvard Square. Her first child, Samuel, was born in Cambridge in 1633.
            They lived there for about five years before moving to Ipswich and later Andover.
            
            <br><br>
            
            Bradstreet reared eight children in all. Her procreative
            years were also a period of great poetic energy. Her most popular work included
            poems to and about family members, although she also wrote some formal elegies.
            One collection, <i>The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung up in America</i>, was published
            in her lifetime without her knowledge or consent (1650). This group of poems,
            published by her brother-in-law in England, had no references to the New World.
            A later, superior compilation, <i>Several Poems Compiled with a Great Variety
                of Wit and Learning</i>, appeared seven years after her death (1678) and included
            her response to the New England landscape, reflecting a Puritan view of life.

            Marilynn Brass is the daughter of Dorothy (Katziff)
            Brass and Harry Brass. Raised in a lively orthodox Jewish household in Winthrop,
            Massachusetts, she was influenced by the enthusiastic cooking of her mother and grandmother.
            As a young woman, she attended Northeastern University where she studied English
            and Journalism, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree <i>cum laude</i>
            and with Departmental Honors in English in 1964. 
            
            <br><br>
            
            She went on to study English
            on a fellowship at Northeastern, receiving her Master of Arts degree in 1966.
            Moving to Cambridge the following year, she lived at the Cambridge YWCA where
            she served as a floor councilor and later became a member of the Y Personnel
            Committee. While there, she assisted in the planning and implementation of a
            Racism Workshop during the turbulent era of the Civil Rights movement. 
            
            <br><br>
            
            When
            first in Cambridge, she worked at the Instrumentation Laboratory at MIT during
            the period when the laboratory was involved with the Apollo Project. When the
            inertial guidance and navigation laboratory was divested from MIT to become
            the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, she moved with it and created and ran the
            Public Communications and Community Affairs Office that dealt with two thousand
            local, national, and international employees.<br>
             More recently, she has worked as a consultant and employee
            for WGBH, within its How-Tos unit that produced programs including &#8220;This
            Old House,&#8221; &#8220;The Victory Garden,&#8221; and &#8220;The New Yankee
            Workshop.&#8221;
            
            <br><br>

            With her older sister, Sheila
                    Brass, she owns and runs Shelmar Antiques, which the sisters started
            when they left their jobs in 1975 to care for their ailing father. They have
            been licensed antique dealers for more than 40 years.
            
            <br><br>
            
            The sisters were the North American Consultants
            for Miller's Publications, in London, for 11 years. They were responsible
            for research, photo shoots, and marketing information for several of Miller's
            books on antiques and collectibles. Marilynn wrote the introduction to the first
            section on rare and collectible cookbooks for Miller's Publications, and
            with her sister, Sheila, were principals in writing and producing a comprehensive
            guide to kitchenware and culinary antiques.
            
            <br><br>
            
            The sisters have always been interested in old cookbooks,
            which gave them an insight into the history of domestic cooking. They began
            to collect both handwritten manuscript and printed cookbooks, culinary advertising
            and culinary antiques, menus, and food molds from all over the world, some dating
            from the seventeenth century. Their collections (which include 6,500 cookbooks)
            and their knowledge of culinary history have led to frequent speaking engagements
            at museums, libraries, and educational institutions throughout the country.<br>
             In 2006, they launched their first publication based
            on manuscript cookbooks, creating a new category of cookbook that translates
            heirloom recipes for the modern kitchen. This book, <i>Heirloom Baking with
                the Brass Sisters</i>, was one of three nominees for a James Beard Foundation
            Award in the Baking and Dessert category in 2007.
            
            <br><br>
            
          Their second book, <i>Heirloom Cooking with the Brass
            Sisters, Recipes You Remember and Love</i>, appeared in October 2008. Both
         this and the previous volume were selected by <i>Food &amp; Wine Magazine</i>
           to be noted among the 25 best cookbooks published in 2007 and 2009, and were
          included in the magazine's volumes <i>The Best of the Best 25 Cookbooks 2007
            and The Best of the Best 25 Cookbooks 2009</i>.
            
            <br><br>
            
            In 2008, the sisters appeared in their own television
            show, &#8220;The Brass Sisters: Queens of Comfort Food,&#8221; which was broadcast
            on WGBH, the Public Television Station in Boston. In 2011, they presented their
            one-hour special, The Brass Sisters Celebrate the Holidays, on the Cooking Channel.
            They were part of a select group to win a &#8220;Throwdown&#8221; with Chef
            Bobby Flay on the Food Network by baking their mother's recipe for Pineapple
            Upside-Down Cake.
            
            <br><br>
            
            With her sister, Sheila, she was honored by the City
            of Cambridge in 2016 when they were named &#8220;Cambridge Food Heroes.&#8221;

        Sheila Brass, with her younger sister Marilynn Brass, was a cookbook co-author and cooking 
        show co-host who elevated heirloom recipes and amassed a valued collection of cookbooks.
        <p>The Brass sisters were lauded by the James Beard Foundation for their heirloom baking cookbook 
        and &ldquo;The Food Flirts,&rdquo; the 2017 PBS show for which they were co-hosts and executive producers.</p>
        <p>Their collection of 6,500 cookbooks, including many that were handwritten, is now housed at Michigan 
        State University&rsquo;s renowned culinary library.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;The sisters were exceptional at breaking down barriers with their personalities and scrumptious
         treats,&rdquo; Denise Drower Swidey, supervising editor for &ldquo;The Food Flirts,&rdquo; told The 
         Boston Globe. The show was a finalist for a James Beard award. Sheila &ldquo;was such an inspiration 
         because she had so many career pivots and life changes as an older woman,&rdquo; Swidey added.</p>
        <p>Sheila was the daughter of Dorothy (Katziff) Brass and Harry Brass. She was raised in a lively orthodox
         Jewish-American household in Winthrop, Massachusetts, where the cooking and baking of her mother and 
         grandmother inspired her.</p>
        <p>She attended Massachusetts College of Art and Design, majoring in Fashion Design and Illustration. 
        She graduated in 1958 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in the top 10 percent of her class.&nbsp;<br>
        She was a fashion designer for ten years in New York and Boston. Her designs were featured in&nbsp;<i>
        Women&apos;s Wear Daily&nbsp;</i>and sold in specialty shops.
        
        <br><br>
        
        She moved to Cambridge in 1972 and 
        became the Director of Marketing for Associates for International Research where she developed cost of 
        living surveys for United States nationals living and working abroad.<br>In 1984, she joined the WGBH 
        Educational Foundation in Boston as the Executive Assistant to the Vice President of National Programming
         for 25 years.
         
         <br><br>
         
         The sisters, licensed antique dealers for more than 40 years, owned and operated 
         Shelmar Antiques.</p>
        <p>The sisters were the North American Consultants for Miller&apos;s Publications, located in London, 
        for 11 years. They were responsible for research, photo shoots, and marketing information for several of
         Miller&apos;s books on antiques and collectibles. Together, they were responsible for the first section
          on rare and collectible cookbooks for Miller&apos;s Publications, and were principals in writing and producing
        a comprehensive guide to kitchenware and culinary antiques.
        
        <br><br>
        
        The sisters have always been interested in 
        old cookbooks, which gave them an insight into the history of domestic cooking. They collected published and 
        unpublished cookbooks, culinary advertising and culinary antiques, menus, and food molds from all over the world, 
        some dating from the seventeenth century. Their collections and knowledge of culinary history led to frequent 
        speaking engagements at museums, libraries, and educational institutions throughout the country.
        
        <br><br>
        
        In 2006, 
        they launched their first publication based on unpublished cookbooks, creating a new category of cookbook that
        translates heirloom recipes for the modern kitchen. This book,&nbsp;<i>Heirloom Baking with the Brass Sisters</i>, 
        was one of three nominees for a James Beard Foundation Award in the Baking and Dessert category.
        
        <br><br>Their 
        second book, <i>Heirloom Cooking with the Brass Sisters</i>, appeared in October 2008. Both this and the previous
        volume were selected by <i>Food &amp; Wine Magazine</i> as among the 25 best cookbooks of the year, and were 
        included in the magazine&apos;s volumes of&nbsp;<i>The Best of the Best Cookbooks</i>.
       
        <br><br>In 2008, the
        sisters appeared on their own television show, &ldquo;The Brass Sisters: Queens of Comfort Food,&rdquo; which
        was broadcast on WGBH, the public television station in Boston. In 2011, they presented their one-hour special,
        &nbsp;&ldquo;The Brass Sisters Celebrate the Holidays&rdquo;&nbsp;on the Cooking Channel. They were part of a 
        select group to win a &ldquo;Throwdown&rdquo; with Chef Bobby Flay on the Food Network by baking their 
        mother&apos;s recipe for Pineapple Upside-Down Cake.</p>
        <p>In 2015, they published&nbsp;<i>Baking with the Brass Sisters: Over 125 Recipes for Classic Cakes, Pies,
         Cookies, Breads, Desserts, and Savories from America&apos;s Favorite Home Bakers.</i>
         
         <br><br>With her sister,
          Marilynn, Sheila was honored by the City of Cambridge in 2016 when they were named &ldquo;Cambridge 
          Food Heroes.&rdquo;

            Born in England, Mary Agnes Burniston was educated
            at Bedford College, University of London. Soon after she married Leslie J Brazier
            in 1928, she finished her Ph.D. degree in physiology at the University of London
            in 1929.

            When the bombing of London began at the beginning of the Second World
            War in 1939, she decided to bring her young son to the United States to ensure
            his safety. Awarded a Rockefeller Fellowship, she began to work in neurophysiology
            laboratories at Massachusetts General Hospital investigating peripheral nerve
            damage and muscular function using the electroenecephalograph as a diagnostic
            tool. After the war, she moved to Massachusetts Institute of Technology where
            she worked with Norbert Wiener and others until 1960, using computers to analyze
            her EEG data. She then moved to the University of California Brain Research
            Institute soon after it was created and was named Professor of Anatomy. Besides
            numerous scientific articles in her field, she published a number of books on
            the history of neurophysiology from the 17th through the 19th century. She became a U.S. 
            citizen while in California, in 1961.
            
            <br><br>At the

        Bread and Roses was a feminist group that seized
        an unoccupied building owned by Harvard University in 1971. The women held the
        

        building for ten days, offering free classes and childcare before they were
        forced out. Sympathetic individuals donated $5,000, and Bread and Roses bought
        a house at 46 Pleasant Street in Cambridge. 
        <br><br>

        In an interview, Tess Ewing explained:

        <blockquote>
       " We defined Bread and Roses as a 'Revolutionary Autonomous Women's Liberation
        Organization.<br>
        1. Revolutionary meant that we supported liberation struggles around the
        world and at home. We saw the Panthers and the black liberation
        movement as part of the 3d world liberation struggle. So we were antiImperialist and anti-racist.
        <br>2. It also meant we were anti-reformist: we didn't want equal rights; we
        wanted liberation [...]
        <br>3. Autonomous meant that we worked on our own, but were always part of
        the larger left."
        </blockquote>
        
        Bread and Roses opened the Women's
            Center in 1972, which ended up being the longest running women's center in the US. Annie
        Popkin, who wrote her doctoral dissertation on this group, has deposited her reference
        materials at Schlesinger library.

            Bread and Roses was co-founded by Pat Hynes and Gill Gane. It opened its doors as a
            woman-owned business for &ldquo;women and their friends&rdquo; after five months of renovating a
            &ldquo;dank,
            dismal&rdquo; neighborhood bar. Except for the plumbing, women did all of the architectural design,
            electrical,
            carpentry, sheet rocking, plastering, and painting, with a backdrop of feminist and lesbian
            singers/songwriters
            playing at full-volume.<br><br>
            
            The name Bread and Roses was adopted from the demand of the
            women-led textile strikers in Lawrence, Massachusetts in 1912: &ldquo;We want bread and roses, too.&rdquo; The
            statement
            was a reflection that the goal of the strike was to ensure that workers could do more than meet basic needs
            .<br><br>

            The project was launched by selling shares of stock to 100 women investors, with the
            Women&rsquo;s Law Collective providing legal support. Instead of tips, Bread and Roses paid above minimum
            wage and chose to donate to a feminist cause each week, such as Rosie&rsquo;s Place, the first shelter in the
            country specifically for poor and homeless women. Every Sunday evening, leftover meals were given to the newly
            opened domestic violence shelter in Cambridge, Transition House. <br><br>

            Twice a month, individual women artists, many who had never shown their art publicly,
            were invited to exhibit their artwork. Radical feminist speakers and performers, like Andrea Dworkin and Mary
            Daly, novelists Tillie Olsen and Alice Walker, musicians Alix Dobkin and Willie Tyson electrified the space, as
            did scientists, and athletes. Once, a woman rushed in, saying, &ldquo;I just arrived from Ireland, and this is
            the first place I wanted to visit!&rdquo;
           <br><br> 
           
           In 1978 the restaurant sold to young feminists who in turn
            opened another one named, Amaranth, which when sold again became Daddio&rsquo;s restaurant (to which a
            Cambridge
            city councilwoman quipped, &ldquo;Given its history, do you have to name it Daddio&rsquo;s?&rdquo;). The
            restaurant Oleana, owned by Executive Chef Ana Sortun, has occupied the space since 2001.

            Charlotte Hawkins Brown was born in North Carolina
            to Caroline Hawkins and Edmund H. Hight. Her extended family moved to Cambridge
            in 1890 when she was seven, where she was raised and educated (55 Essex Street).

            <Br><Br>When Charlotte was about three years old, according to the Charlotte Hawkins Brown Museum... 
            <blockquote>
            "By the
             time that I was twelve years old my desire for leadership had asserted itself, and in the city of Cambridge 
             I had organized a little kindergarten department in the Sunday School of the Union Baptist Church. Before I
              was fourteen years of age, I had been chosen orator on a very important occasion when the minister of the 
              church was celebrating his fifteenth anniversary as pastor, and in the presence of the governor of the 
              State and his council I had dared to eulogize this pastor and receive the plaudits of the great throng."
              </blockquote>

            Charlotte attended public schools in Cambridge, including the Cambridge English High School. 
            She then attended Massachusetts State Normal School. 
            
            <br><br>In 1902, after a year in North
            Carolina, she founded the Palmer Memorial Institute there. This began as a rural
            county school but gradually developed into a private preparatory school for
            middle-class African American children, named after the Wellesley College president
            Alice Freeman Palmer who had funded her education. Although originally intended
            to educate all county children, she soon began to emphasize secondary and junior
            college education. She met and married a Harvard graduate, Edward S. Brown,
            but the marriage lasted only five years. She remained with the school for almost 50 years.
            
            <br><br> Attracting funding and students throughout
            the country, Charlotte Hawkins Brown continued to return to Cambridge each summer
            to raise money for the Institute and to continue her studies at Harvard, Wellesley
            and Simmons colleges. As the Institute grew more famous, she traveled throughout
            the country to lecture on African American education and interracial cooperation
            and received a number of honorary degrees.

            Sara Thorp, daughter of a Wisconsin lumber baron,
            Joseph Thorp, married Ole Bull, a renowned Norwegian concert violinist, in 1870
            when he was sixty years old and she only twenty. The marriage took place over
            the objections of her father but with approval of her mother. A daughter, Olea,
            was born a year later and for a few years they lived in Madison in a house her
            father built for them.
            
            <br><br>Sara took an active role in Ole Bull's complicated
            financial affairs. The family moved to Cambridge and rented James Russell Lowell's
            house while they had a house built for them at 168 Brattle Street. After Ole's
            death, Sara wrote his biography, <i>Ole Bull: A Memoir</i>, which was published
            by Houghton-Mifflin in 1883. She was active in the cultural and social circles
            of Boston and Cambridge, and became a close companion of important figures including
            Julia Ward Howe, Annie Allegra Longfellow Thorp, daughter of the poet Henry
            Wadsworth Longfellow, who married her brother Joseph Gilbert Thorp, Alice Longfellow,
            and Sara Orne Jewett. 
            
            <br><br>Sara Bull's most notable project was initiating
            and sponsoring the Cambridge Conferences. These were held at her home on Brattle
            Street, bringing together leading intellectual, artistic, and philosophical
            figures for a series of lectures offered each spring and fall from 1896 through
            1899. She was also a charter member of the Cambridge Garden Club. In the later
            years of her life, Sara became interested in Eastern religions and became a
            follower of Swami Vivekanada and his Vedanta philosophy.

            Born to Mary (Shotwell) and Henry A. Ingraham
            in Brooklyn, Mary was educated as a scientist, graduating from Vassar in 1931
            with a degree in physics and obtaining her Ph.D. from University of Wisconsin
            in 1934. <br><br>
            
            Her early papers on color variations in the bacterium <i>Serratia
                marcescens</i> were significant studies in microbial genetics. In 1937 she
            married Henry Bunting. She taught biology at a number of colleges, including
            Bennington, Gaucher, Yale, and Wellesley. After the death of her husband in
            1954, she took an administrative position at Douglass College for Women, Rutgers
            University in 1955. She was named president of Radcliffe College in Cambridge in 1960 and
            held that position until 1973 (in 1963, she was living at 6 Brattle Street). As president,
             she made a number of significant
            changes at Radcliffe. During her tenure, Radcliffe students first received Harvard
            degrees, women were admitted to the graduate and business schools, and the Radcliffe
            Graduate School merged with Harvard's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
            <br><br>
            
            Bunting established the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study, initially
            designed to encourage the furthering of the careers of talented women who taken
            off time to raise a family. In 1972, she left the presidency of Radcliffe and
            took a position as special assistant to the president of Princeton University,
            where she remained until 1975, guiding the university through its first years
            as a co-educational institution. 
            
            <br><br>In 1979, she married for the second time to
            a Harvard Medical School pediatrician, Dr. Clement A. Smith. After his death
            in 1988, she spent the remainder of her life in a continuing care facility in
            New Hampshire.

        Jeanne Burton was an active member of the Cambridge community, serving on a variety of boards,
        advocating for racial justice and doing volunteer work.
         
        Her father William Washington (born in California) was a tailor and her mother Martha Marshall (born in North Carolina), 
        was a supervisor of 
        <a href="https://cwhp.cambridgema.gov/bios.html?last=WindowShop&middle=&first=">The Window Shop</a> in Harvard Square 
        for over 20 years.<br><br>

        In the 1970s, Burton was a "Mother's March Captain," helping to raise money for causes like the March of Dimes.
        In 1984, Burton recieved Cambridge's Racial Justice Award. She had been a member of the Cambridge Food Co-op's Board of 
        Trustees and was...
        
        <blockquote>
        "...recognized for her ongoing efforts to educate Co-Op members and staff about the damaging effects of
         institutional racism. Burton was also [instrumental] in the development of an affrimative action program at the Co-Op."
         </blockquote>

        Burton's mother had joined the Co-Op the first year that it opened and in 1983. Burton appeared at a Cambridge 
        City Council meeting to discuss issues of racism at the co-op, saying:
        <blockquote>
        "There are instances of discrimination that are so many, so plentiful, that I can't go into them here...That 
        kind of attitude is something that has to be dealt with, and not from within the co-op, because it is clear
         nothing is going to happen from within...I'm asking the city to send someone into the co-op [the co-op 
         received grants from the city] and confer with our board and with our manager about what the HUD regulations
          are in hiring and membership..."
        </blockquote>
        
        In 1985, Burton testified in front of the State legislature on the need to do more to help Alzheimer's 
        patients and their families.
 
        Burton was later a member of the board of
        directors of the Cambridge Council on Aging. She was elected vice president
        in 1996 and president in 1997. She also served as vice president of the American
        Association of Retired Persons (AARP).  She was living at 929 Massachusetts Avenue at the time.
        
        <br><br>
        She served on the city's advisory
        group during the development of the accessible taxi services, and also has served
        on the board of the Alzheimer's Association, the YWCA, CEOC, the Vision
        Foundation, the Cambridge Commission for Persons with Disabilities, and the
        school's panel to interview school principals. She offered consultation
        to CASCAP on the development of affordable assisted living units at Harvard
        Place in Cambridge.

        Gladys Marion Canada's father was Ambrose Canada, who was born 1882 in Tennessee.  Her mother was
         Ellen Louise Harvey (born in Virginia).  Gladys' grandfather Anthony Canada was born in 1851 in Virginia and being an
        African American, this likely means he was born into slavery.  <br><br>

        By the early 1900s, Gladys' grandfather Anthony had moved to Cambridge and the
        family lived on Harvey St. in North Cambridge.  They later moved to North Woburn,
        where Gladys had her early schooling and she went on to attend the Boston Industrial
        Trade School in the early 1920s, where she excelled in sewing (the school in the North End still exists today). <br><br>

        In 1926, she married Frank R. Butler, who worked as a porter, and by 1941 they had
        moved into a house on Hubbard Avenue in North Cambridge. Gladys was a dedicated mother 
        to her two sons Paul and James and a devoted member of the Union Baptist Church (UBC) in Central
        Square for over 50 years, where she served on many committees.  
        UBC was founded in 1877 by African Americans in Cambridge and Gladys was a 
        member of UBC when Martin Luther King, Jr. preached there in April of 1955.

        narrative: `


    Four-time Iditarod Champion, Susan Butcher, was born and grew up in Cambridge. She attended The 
    Warehouse Cooperative School, an alternative school located in a vacated warehouse in an industrial 
    area in Roxbury.  She attributed her love of outdoor adventures to vacations spent in the Maine woods 
    during her childhood. Butcher studied to become a veterinary technician at Colorado State University. 
    She moved to Alaska in 1975, to pursue her passion for dogsled racing and to train for the Iditarod 
    Trail Sled Dog Race.<br><br>

    Butcher, who raced in her first Iditarod, a grueling 1,100 mile race from Anchorage to
    Nome, in 1978, finished in the top five from 1980 to 1984. In 1985, she was leading in the early
    stages of the race when a sick and dying moose blundered into her path on the trail. A few
    frantic minutes later, two of Butcher's dogs were dead, others were injured and she was out of
    the race. In 1986, she became the second woman to win the race. She added victories in 1987,
    1988, and 1990, and finished in the top four through 1993. Butcher finished in the top five in 12
    of her 17 attempts at the Iditarod from 1978 to 1994. Her success brought unprecedented
    attention to the race.<br><br>

    Butcher's careful training and treatment of her dogs revolutionized the sport. She raised
    and trained dogs with her husband at Trail Breakers Kennel near Fairbanks, Alaska. In a 1990
    interview with <i>The Boston Globe</i>, Butcher commented on her relationship with her sled dogs,
    "They used to say this race was one-third dog, one-third musher, and one-third luck, but I think
    I changed that. I am meticulous about training and caring for my dogs. They're everything - my
    friends, family, and co-workers. They are the athletes and are trained and chosen for
    competition just like any athlete."<br><br>

    In 1994, Butcher ran her last Iditarod, when she decided to have children. She had two
    daughters, Tekla and Chisana, with her husband, lawyer and musher, David Monson. She
    passed away in 2006, at age 51, in Seattle, WA, from leukemia. In 2008, the Alaska state
    legislature established Susan Butcher Day, to be observed on the first Saturday of March each
    year. Later that year, the University of Alaska at Fairbanks announced the creation of the Susan
    Butcher Institute, to develop public service and leadership skills among young Alaskans.

        title: `Activist, teacher, writer`,

        narrative: `


        Barbara Beckwith grew up in New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, moving to 
        Cambridge in 1965 where she enthusiastically took on the roles of activist, journalist, 
        teacher, and essayist.<br><br>

        In the 1970s and 1980s, Barbara was involved in local fights for rent control, educational 
        access, withdrawal from the Vietnam War, women's liberation, ending the nuclear arms race, 
        social responsibility in science, and writers' rights.<br><br>

        In the 1970s, she went door-to-door to advocate for rent control, and then to end the 
        Vietnam War. In the 1980s, alarmed by the nuclear arms buildup during President Reagan's 
        presidency, she and other Cambridge women formed an affinity group and participated in civil 
        disobedience at various sites, including at an arms marketing event at the Colonnade Hotel in
        Cambridge. Arrested twice for trespassing, she did community service, per a judge's orders.<br><br>

        Barbara was committed to Cambridge's public schools, which her two sons attended. 
        She helped launch the Cambridge School Volunteers Program (museum kits and speakers programs) 
        and the city's after-school program. As education chair of the Civic Unity Committee, 
        she pressed for more Black teachers, library books, curriculum, and participated in the 
        hiring of Cambridge's first African American Superintendent of Schools, Alfonso Cheatham.
        As Clerk of the Cambridge Civic Association, she worked on progressive platforms.<br><br>

        Starting in the 1970s, Barbara taught English for 12 years at Pilot School in Cambridge and Home Base in 
        Watertown, both alternative public high schools. She developed courses on subjects such 
        as <i>Real People</i> (interviewing), <i>Language and Power</i>, and <i>Assertiveness</i>.<br><br>

        She worked with Cambridge-based non-profit FairTest to co-author <i>Standing Up to the SAT</i> 
        (ARCO, 1989), a critique of standardized tests. In the 1990s, she was active in Cambridge-based
        Educators for Social Responsibility, where she and other teachers developed teaching guides 
        on nuclear issues and concepts of peace. She served on the editorial board of Science for 
        the People, based in Central Square, and with her husband Jon, was active in its sociobiology
         study group.<br><br>

        Barbara returned to college in her 40s to get a journalism degree, worked at the Middlesex 
        News and Brookline Chronicle, and then became a freelance writer (the Cambridge Chronicle published 
        her first feature article on Huron Ave women business owners.) She published articles and 
        essays in local, regional, national and movement/feminist newspapers, magazines, anthologies, 
        and radio. She was for many years a news editor and contributor to the Cambridge-based feminist
        journal, <i>Sojourner: the Women's Forum</i>.<br><br>

        In the 1990s, she taught journalism as an adjunct professor at Framingham State College, 
        Suffolk University, and Emerson College, and led journalism, travel and essay writing workshops
        at the Cambridge Center for Adult Education. Barbara was a National Writers Union's activist
        and Boston Chapter Steering Committee member, serving three terms on the national executive
        board. In 1991, PEN New England awarded her their "Friend to Writers" award for organizing
            biennial "For Love AND Money" writers' conferences held at the John F Kennedy School of
            Government. She was also the union's Series Advisor for the <i>Writers Life</i> monthly speaker
            series at the Cambridge Center for Adult Education.<br><br>

        As a member of the NWU national and local diversity committees, Barbara worked to prioritize 
        issues vital to writers of color, LGBTQ writers, and writers with disabilities. She built a 
        "Publishers and Editors Who Work with Writers of Color" database. She also worked with 100 
        writers to produce the union's <i>Building Strength Through Diversity</i> handbook (2002).<br><br>

        The more Barbara became aware of the complexity of anti-Black racism, she determined to take 
        action in every sphere (institutional, interpersonal, individual) of her life. She joined 
        Community Change Inc's anti-racism library committee, and volunteered as a Gustavus Meyers 
        Awards book reviewer.<br><br>

        In the 1990s, she worked to challenge institutional, cultural, and individual racism. In 2001,
        She became a co-facilitator of <i>"White People Challenging Racism: Moving from Talk to Action"</i> 
        workshops at the Cambridge Center for Adult Education, and co-led workshops or spoke at White
        Privilege conferences, at racial justice conferences in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and at
        Cambridge's Women's Explore lecture/discussion series.<br><br>

        She compiled her personal essays that pondered racism and white privilege (including her own) 
        into a booklet series: <i>What Was I Thinking? Reflecting on Everyday Racism</i> (2009), <i>Digging Deeper
        into Everyday Racism</i> (2013) and <i>Questions and Quandaries</i> (2015).
        <br><br>
        Beckwith's 2013 essay, "Why Read Slave Narratives?" exemplifies her reflective and honest style of writing.
         She relates her past avoidance of narratives written about the horrors of slavery and of the Holocaust and 
         then writes:
        
         <blockquote>

        "...In both cases, I feared that they'd be solely about bondsmen and bondswomen stripped of dignity, agency,
         and humanity.<br><br>

        "My change of heart and mind started with a plaque I noticed in front of a house in my neighborhood in 
        Cambridge. Installed as part of my city's new African American Heritage Trail, it marked the home of
         Harriett Jacobs, who, more than 150 years ago, self-published under the pseudonym Linda Brent, a memoir 
         of her enslavement, escape, and life as an emancipated woman.
        <br><br>

        "As a fellow writer, I was intrigued. So I put my qualms aside, and read Jacobs' "Incidents in the Life 
        of a Slave Girl Written by Herself", and then a dozen other books penned by men and women who had endured
         bondage.
            <br><br>

        "I found that yes, they describe the horror of forced labor, rape, hunger, thirst, 16-hour workdays, 
        illiteracy, and brutality. But they're also a testament to endurance and resistance."
        </blockquote>
        
        The essay concludes with:
        
        <blockquote>
        "...We need these stories to balance our images of victims with counter images of resilience and
         resistance. And to know what forms of resistance we, too, are capable of, when humanity requires 
         it in the face of inhumanity."
         </blockquote>

        In her 80s, Barbara coached a Women's Writing Workshop for older women who live in Mission 
        Hill, Fenway, Jamaica Plain, Roxbury and Dorchester. The free workshop culminated in <i>From
         Our Notebooks: Essays, Stories, and Reflections booklets </i>(2017, 2019).<br><br>

        When her husband was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2020, she wrote essays to explore her
        perspective on their experience, freely sharing her "Learning to Care" series with others facing
        caregiving challenges, at home and in memory care facilities.

        narrative: `

        Betty Butterfield was a volunteer at the annual Bryn Mawr College used book sale in Princeton, New Jersey, 
        in the 1950s. She moved to Cambridge in 1954 and four years later launched a small book sale as a fundraiser
         for her alma mater. By 1971, that fundraiser had become a nonprofit seller of used and rare books, located 
         at 373 Huron Avenue in West Cambridge. The store remains at that address more than 50 years later (Betty 
         and another volunteer bought the building, which was then purchased in the 1980s by the bookstore with an 
         interest-free loan).<br><br>

        Through Betty's leadership, all of the books for the Bryn Mawr Book Store are donated, the staff is volunteer, and
        the profits fund scholarships at Bryn Mawr. Betty, who would volunteer at the store about 20 hours each week and 
        loved books and book-selling, once remarked on "the pleased reactions of gluttonous customers." Her daughter, 
        Hester Butterfield, remembers reading aloud at the dinner table excerpts from the day's best donations.
        Betty's husband, Lyman H. Butterfield, a historian knowledgeable about rare books, helped with the sorting and 
        pricing of books in the basement of their home in Cambridge.<br><br>

        Over the years the store has donated more than $2 million for scholarships. The scholarships had special meaning 
        for Betty: her father lost everything in the Depression and Bryn Mawr allowed her to enroll even when she couldn't
        afford tuition.<br><br>

        Betty worked full-time at Harvard University for 19 years, including as assistant to the dean of Radcliffe College, 
        assistant registrar of the faculty, and secretary of the Social Studies Department. She was known for her efficiency 
        and was well-liked, especially by undergraduates, for helping them navigate the bureaucracy. Unhappy with how much 
        the department was spending on food for the senior-faculty dinner, she made all the food herself.<br><br>

        Betty was also involved in social activism. At a 1970 rally against the Vietnam War, her endorsement to the crowd 
        of a university-wide strike at Harvard to protest the invasion of Cambodia and the killing of four students at 
        Kent State University was met with "thunderous applause," according to <i>The Harvard Crimson</i> (in 1972, she was living
        at 5 Berkeley Place in Cambridge).<br><br>

        There were once nine Bryn Mawr bookstores across the Northeast, but the Cambridge store and The Lantern in 
        Washington, D.C., are the only survivors. In 2024, the store received a Cambridge Business Award, recognizing
        its longevity and rich contribution to Cambridge's retail environment. Upon her death, the family asked that 
        contributions be made, in lieu of flowers, to help maintain the Bryn Mawr Book Store in its nonprofit status.

        narrative: `

       Alma Boudreau was a book lover (in the 1970s, she stated
       that every 2-3 weeks she would check out close to ten books from her local library) 
       and a dedicated patron of the Cambridge Public Library system, 
       serving on its Board of Trustees for 57 years, from the 1930s into the 1980s.<br><br>

        Alma grew up in Cambridge, the youngest of seven children, with her mother Jane and her
         father (a carpenter) John C. Boudreau. Both of her parents were originally from 
         French-speaking Nova Scotia. The family initially lived on Walden Street and Alma 
         later resided on Lakeview Avenue.<br><br>

        Alma attended the Russell Elementary School on Larch Road, acted in Cambridge-based musical comedies 
        in her teens, and attended Marycliffe Academy in Arlington, which was founded in the early
        1900s by nuns from France, specifically to serve the children of French-speaking immigrants.<br><br>

        Alma became a clerk for the New England Telephone Company in the late 1920s, working at the
        Temple Street office in Cambridge. She remained with the company for 47 years. In addition 
        to her work with the telephone company, Alma became a member of the Board of Trustees for 
        the Cambridge Public Library in the 1930s and remained in that position for 57 years. Alma 
        was for decades part of fundraisers for Cambridge's Holy Ghost Hospital Guild, which later
        became Youville Hospital, where she served as a trustee for seven years. By the 1950, 
        Alma was living at 20 Langdon Street in Cambridge<br><br>

        For most of her life, Alma was a close friend of Marion Hurley, the wife of the governer 
        of Massachusetts. At a June 1979 celebration in honor of Alma's 41 years work for the 
        Cambridge Public Library, the Cambridge Chronicle ran an article entitled “Alma Boudreau doesn't 
        know what all the fuss is about." A retired New England Telephone Company manager and congressional aide
        to House Speaker Tip O'Neill described Alma as a "perfectionist, who knew every fact of her job" 
        and "has a lively sense of humor." The same article quoted Alma as saying
        
        <blockquote>
        "You might have thought 
        I put every brick in every branch library building. Well, I didn't. Now let's go have some tea!”
        </blockquote>

        In 1989, the Observatory 
        Hill Branch of the Cambridge Public Library, located at 245 Concord Avenue, was named in Alma's honor, for her 
        dedication and decades of service.

    //   Ann Wadden Bolger grew up in Cambridge (lived on Harvard Street?). She attended Cambridge High and Latin School
    //    where she was part of the French Club, the Outing Club, and the Drama club and preformed in "A Connecticut 
    //    Yankee In King Arthur's Court" in 1949.<br><br>

    //     Bolger, as a single mother raising five children, was heavily involved in advocating for Cambridge Schools.
    //      In 1982, there was a discussion (and a bit of controversy) over renaming the newly-combined Cambridge Alternative
    //       Schools (CPS) and the Daniel Webster School the Rosa Parks School. Bolger was a parent coordinator for the 
    //       "New Alternative Webster School" (a temporary name) and was interviewed in the Cambridge Chronicle: 

    //     <blockquote>
    //     "Everyone was free to suggest a name. It could be a famous person, a not so famous person, a concept of an 
    //     idea, or a geographic area. [The only restriction was] that the word 'Alternative' appear in the new name. 
    //     Some of the suggested names were really unusual—a lot of thought went into it. Several people...suggested 
    //     it would be nice to have a Cambridge school named for a minority woman. 
    //     <Br><br>

    //     "Names like 'Umojo,' and African word for unity, and 'Calliope,' a musical instrument in which all the 
    //     parts have to work together [were included in the suggestions.]"
    //     </blockquote>

    //     Bolger also served on the Cambridge School Volunteers and was part of the CSV Long Range Planning 
    //     Committee. She stayed involved in the schools for more than 20 years and upon her passing, the Graham 
    //     and Parks School library was renamed in her honor.

    //     In 1983, Bolger was featured on a local cable TV show and talked about Central Square at the time:

    //     <blockquote>
    //     "When I look over to Central Square, I see the edge of many communities. It's sort of that no man's land 
    //     of stores and businesses. All of us in the bordering neighborhoods—Mid-Cambridge, Area Four, Cambridgeport 
    //     and Riverside—should think about including Central Square as a part of our communities."
    //     </blockquote>

    //     Bolger was a teacher herself and taught fourth grade in the Groton Public schools for almost 20 years.  
    //     She was also a liberal activist. According to her obituary, with her identity was formed "during the women’s 
    //     rights, civil rights, and anti-war movements of the 1960’s.  She worked on several political campaigns during 
    //     the 1960’s and 1970’s and was especially proud of her work for Eugene McCarthy in 1968."  
    //     <br><br>Bolger is buried in Cambridge Cemetery. 

    //     1950 census: 159 Concord Ave., with sister Eleanor (checks out w/obit)
    //     father Joseph was a physician, mother Margaret<Br><br>

    //     1970 was Longfellow Community School council secretary (lived on St. Paul St.)<Br><br>

    //     1972: lived at 10 St. Paul St.,  married to Francis X. Bolger, carpenter at MGH. She's listed as "Ann P. Bolger"<Br><br>

    //     '85-'96 was living in Groton, but articles in Cambridge Chronicle showing her serving on groups
    //      for Cambridge Schools and 1987 article talking about Central Square (mentions her growing up on
    //       Harvard St. and living on St. Paul). This following up on a 1983 article about Central Sq. that 
    //       quotes her (and gives her address as St. Paul Street)<Br><br>

    //     1996 - obit for a Florence T. Keefe says mother of Ann Bolger of Cambridge - different Ann Bolger?<Br><br>

    //     1998 Ann Bolger was parent liaison for Graham and Parks<Br><br>
