        narrative: `
            Martha May Eliot was born in 1891 in Dorchester
            to Christopher Rhodes Eliot, a Unitarian minister, and Mary Jackson May. She
            attended Radcliffe College in Cambridge, graduating in 1913, the same year as
            her friend and life-partner, Ethel Collins Dunham, who like Eliot, went on in
            pediatrics and received her M.D. degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1918.
            After a residency in pediatrics at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston, May
            was appointed as a resident at Yale University and rose through the ranks to
                 a position on the faculty. <br><br>

            With Edwards Park she developed a treatment
            for rickets using cod-liver oil, vitamin D and exposure to sun. In 1924, she
            was named director of the Division of Child and Maternal Health at the U.S.
            Children's Bureau on a part-time basis while she continued to teach and
            practice at Yale, but moved to Washington when she was appointed to the full
            time position of assistant chief at the bureau. <br><br>

            During the Second World War, she studied the effects
            of moving children out of the cities to the countryside in England and published
            a book on the subject. She also headed a federal program, Emergency Maternity
            and Infant Care, which provided health care and assistance for wives and infants
            of armed forces personnel for which she was awarded the Lasker prize in 1948.
            She was the first woman to be elected president of the American Public Health
            Association in 1947. <br><br>

            In 1948, she was elected president of the National
            Conference on Social Welfare. She was the first woman ever awarded the American
            Public Health Association's Sedgewick Memorial Medal, in 1958. Soon after the
            war, Eliot was a member of the group that founded the World Health Organization,
            the only woman to sign its founding document. She left the Children's
            Bureau to serve as assistant director general of W.H.O. in Geneva from 1949 to 1951.
            On her return, she was appointed chief of the Children's Bureau. When
            she left the Bureau in 1956, she became chair of the School of Public Health
            at Harvard Medical School until her retirement in 1960, when she was living at 21 Francis Avenue
            in Cambrige, near the Harvard Divinity School. She introduced the use
            of social workers into public health programs. 
            
            <br><br>In 1964 the American Public Health
            Association established an annual award in her name to recognize her achievements
            in maternal and child health. In 1972, she was awarded the prestigious Howland
            prize by that organization, the first woman to receive it (at the time, she was living
            at 21 Francis Avenue in Cambridge).

            Tess
            Ewing was one of a group of women that occupied the Harvard-owned building at
            888 Memorial Drive in 1971, at which demands were made to address women's issues
            including the demand for a women's center, affordable housing, and child care.
            The event later resulted in a donation of money that was used as down payment
            for a building at 46 Pleasant Street, and the Cambridge
                Women's Center was founded in 1972. 
                
                <br><br>Ewing was one of the founders
            of the Cambridge Women's Center, and of the Cambridge
                Women's School that operated for several years out of the Center.
            Before the building takeover, she was active in Bread
                and Roses, a Boston area women's liberation organization.<br><Br>

            Ewing
            has been a labor activist since the mid 1970's, when she was one of the
            organizers of the Boston School Bus Drivers Union (USWA Local 8751). She was
            a school bus driver for thirteen years, during which she served two terms as
            local union president. Following that, she worked for the laundry workers'
            union (LDCIU Local 66), as business agent. She also served as president of that
            local for two years.<br><br>

            During the 1980s, Ewing became involved in training
            and educating union members, mostly through the Women's Institute for Leadership
            Development (WILD) an organization whose mission is to give working women, especially
            women of color, the skills to become activists and leaders in their unions.
            When UMass started a Labor Extension Program, she became coordinator of the
            program on the Boston campus. In this capacity, she continued the work of educating
            union members and other working people about their rights and how to exercise
            them effectively. She hosted a program on the Cambridge local access channel
            on women and labor issues. She has served as secretary and treasurer of the
            United Association for Labor Education (UALE), the professional association
            of labor educators, and treasurer of the Gay and Lesbian Labor Activists Network
            (GALLAN), and is a member of the Board of WILD. <br><br>

            Ewing retired from UMass/Boston in 2012 and lives in Cambridge with her partner of many decades, 
            Louise Rice. Together they have raised two sons: Jethro Rice, who
            is currently living in Vietnam with his wife Kanako Matsumoto; and Dan Rice, 
            who lives in Maryland with his wife Thulie and two children, Kali and Avery.<br><br>

            After retirement, Ewing hosted a monthly community access TV program on women and work, 
            and has been a part of the Cambridge Committee to Raise the Minimum Wage.`,

        Dr. Ruth Marguerite Easterling was born in South Carolina and raised in Cambridge, Massachusetts, 
        residing much of her life at 55 Dana Street. She was the only child of James and Mary Easterling,
        and her father worked as a railroad porter. Dr. Easterling attended the Ellis Grammar School at 
        40 Norris Street and graduated from Cambridge High and Latin High School with honors. 
        
        <br><br>Easterling attended
        Jackson College for Women, a "coordinate" college of Tufts University, studying pre-medicine. 
        In 1917, she was the first African American woman to be admitted to Tufts University School of 
        Medicine, and she graduated in 1921.<br><br>

        Dr. Easterling moved to New York to begin her internship at Metropolitan Hospital on Welfare Island, 
        where she received training from New York Medical College faculty. Dr. Easterling began her career 
        as a pathologist with Harvard Laboraties and Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. There she worked with
        Dr. Augustus Hinton (a son of freed slaves), helping him with the Hinton test for syphilis. She 
        later worked on tuberculosis research with Dr. John B. West, and their findings were published in
        1939. Dr. Easterling also worked for a time at the Tuskegee Veterans Administration Hospital in
        Alabama. 
        
        <br><br>
        She later returned to Cambridge and was named Director of Laboratories at the Cambridge 
         City Hospital. In 1943, at the age of 45, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. 
        
         <br><br>Upon her death that same year, she was recognized by the Massachusetts House of Representatives 
        and the City of Cambridge for her enormous contributions to the community and science. Tufts 
        University School of Medicine continues to celebrate her legacy with a portrait in the Sackler 
        School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences and a scholarship in her name.
