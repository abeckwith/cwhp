        narrative: `
            Adeline M. Ireson was the daughter of Mary and
            Samuel Ireson. At the age of sixteen, she passed an examination to attend the
            first state funded teacher training school in the nation, the Normal School
            of Lexington, as a member of its first class of 1839, graduating with twenty-five
            other young women in 1840. Their principal and teacher was a Unitarian minister,
            Rev. Cyrus Peirce who was supported by his wife, Harriet Peirce. A model school
            for children was set up in Lexington and the young teachers took turns teaching
            in the school. They were examined at the end of their training by Horace Mann
            ((then actively working for the initiation of teacher training schools and public
            school education in Massachusetts) and Samuel Gridley Howe who also attended
            their graduation ceremony. (Another member of this class was Hannah Damon of
            West Cambridge (now Arlington) the daughter of a Unitarian minister. She served
            as class secretary, often wrote poetry and lyrics for the alumnae celebrations.
            She taught for a while in Worcester and Boston and died in 1901).<br><br>
            In the published records of the First Class of
            the Normal School of Lexington (1839) to which Adeline Ireson belonged, she
            is remembered from her school days as &#8220;Addie Ireson always at hand to
            do one a kindness&#8221;. She began to teach in Cambridge in 1842. For the Seventh
            meeting of the class in 1856, Ireson addressed the class arguing that unmarried
            women could accomplish as much and keep their hearts as fresh and loving as
            their married friends.<br><br>
            Adeline Ireson was considered by her classmates to be their most distinguished
            member, certainly the most dedicated teacher. She was honored for her fifty
            years of teaching in the Washington Grammar School in Cambridge at a large meeting
            held at Sanders Theater July 1, 1892. Among the tributes was a letter from the
            governor of the Commonwealth, William Russell, who had been one of her pupils
            as was his son, and another letter was sent from Alice Freeman Palmer. Ireson
            was also awarded a yearly sum of $129, subscribed to by one hundred of her neighbors
            and former pupils including the mayor of the city and the Harvard University
            president. She was still alive (although ill and bedridden) in 1902. An appendix
            to a history of the first class of the Lexington Normal School recounts the
            ceremony on her retirement. In celebration of its 150th anniversary, The Framingham
            State College, an outgrowth of Lexington Normal, posted a reproduction of a
            flowered dress of Adeline Ireson from 1839 and included a history of the early
            school. The Historical Commission holds a silhouette of her as a young woman.
