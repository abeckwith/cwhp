            Isabella Halsted was the daughter of Charles Hopkinson,
            a Cambridge born portrait artist who painted over thirty members of the Harvard
            faculty, and Elinor (Curtis) Hopkinson, who was related to the Longfellow family.
            Although her home was in Manchester, Isabella also stayed in Cambridge while
            attending the Buckingham and Winsor schools. She attended Bryn Mawr College
            for two years in the mid-1920s and then studied at the Art Students League in
            New York City for two more years.<br><br> In 1930, she married James Halsted, a physician,
            after which she lived in Boston, Cleveland, Dedham, and Los Angeles, CA. After
            the marriage ended in divorce in 1951, Isabella Halsted returned to Cambridge
            and decided to learn typing and stenography. Isabella worked as secretary to
            the dean of residents at Radcliffe College, as membership secretary at the Boston
            Museum of Fine Arts, and as director of the newly formed Boston Center for International
            Visitors, from 1961-1967 (she was living at 988 Memorial Drive in Cambridge at the time). 
            There she hosted foreign guests of the State Department,
            welcoming them into her home in Cambridge and learning about their cultures.
            <br><br>
            Isabella Halsted also initiated and led a campaign
            to close Memorial Drive to automobile traffic on Sundays during the summer months
            (Riverbend Park) for which she was celebrated with a memorial stone bench in
            Longfellow Park, between Memorial Drive and Mt. Auburn Street. <br><br>
            She
            was the author of <em>The Aunts</em>, a 1992 memoir of the four Curtis sisters
            of Beacon Hill and Manchester. Some of her letters from her father are held
            in the Charles Hopkinson collection in the Smithsonian Archives of American
            Art. The Curtis family papers, in the Schlesinger Library, include some material
            written by her mother. `,

            Born in Fort Wayne, Indiana, to Gertrude (Pond)
            and Montgomery Hamilton, Alice was educated first at Miss Porter's School
            in Connecticut and then attended the University of Michigan Medical School,
            graduating in 1893 and interned at the Hospital for Women and Children in Minneapolis
            and at the New England Hospital for Women and Children in Boston. <br><br>In 1897, she
            was named the first woman professor at the Women's Medical School of Northwestern
            University as professor of pathology. During this period, she lived at the famous
            settlement house, Hull House, founded by Jane Addams. She noticed the numbers
            of immigrants sickened by toxins produced by Chicago factories, and began to
            study occupational hazards from various chemicals. She served on the Occupational
            Disease Commission in Illinois and then joined the staff of the U.S. Department
            of Labor. <br><br>In 1919, she joined the new Department of Industrial Medicine at Harvard
            Medical School as an assistant professor, the first woman to be appointed to
            the medical faculty. She remained there for sixteen years without a promotion,
            excluded as a member of the Harvard Faculty Club. She went on to publish a number
            of important books, most notably <em>Industrial Toxicology</em> (1934) and including
            an autobiography, <em>Exploring the Dangerous Trades: The Autobiography of Alice
                Hamilton</em> (1943). She was the only member of the League of Nations Health
            Committee (1924-1930). <br><br>After her retirement, she continued to be active in both
            national and local groups and to support liberal causes. She was awarded many
            honorary degrees in her retirement years.`,

            Margaret Hamilton graduated from
            Hancock High School in 1954 and then attended Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana,
            graduating in 1958 as a major in mathematics. <br><br>She moved to Massachusetts with
            the intention of doing graduate study at Brandeis but instead took a position
            at MIT where she learned to write software for computers. She postponed her
            graduate work for a chance to work on software for the Apollo program and eventually
            became the director of software programming at MIT's Instrumentation Laboratory
            for the Apollo and Skylab NASA missions, overseeing the moon flights. She produced
            over 130 papers, proceeding and reports. Hamilton's work in the software field was extensive and has
            been credited with coining the term "Software Engineering."<br><br>
            In 1986, she founded and became CEO of Hamilton Technologies, in Cambridge,
            a software company. She has been recognized with the Augusta Ada Lovelace Award
            by the Association of Women in Computing in 1986 and the NASA Exceptional Space
            Act Award, in 2003 for her contributions to the Apollo Program and to the field
            of software engineering.
            
            <Br><Br>In 2016, Barack Obama awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
            In a Cambridge Chronicle article at the time, MIT professor Jaime Paraire said:<blockquote>
            "She was a true software engineering pioneer, and it's not hyperbole to say that she, and the instrumentation
             Lab's Software Engineering Division that she led, put us on the moon."</blockquote>
             In the same article, the MIT News author stated:<blockquote>
             "Hamilton had become an icon for women in science and technology, especially in the few years since a 
             now-famous photo, showing her next to a printout of her MIT team's Appolo code, began circulating online.</blockquote>  `,

            A Cambridge resident, Judith Lewis Herman has
            done ground breaking research on post-traumatic disorders and sexual violence
            against women and children. <br><br>She grew up in the New York area, daughter of secular
            Jews. Her father, Naphtali Lewis, was a professor of classics at Brooklyn College
            and her mother, Helen Block Lewis, trained as a clinical psychologist and later
            became a Yale professor. Both parents were involved in social activism and both
            suffered from political repression during the McCarthy era. Judith Lewis attended
            Radcliffe College, graduating in 1964. As a student, she participated in the
            Civil Rights Movement and the Anti-War Movement, and became involved in &quot;second
            wave&quot; feminism in the late sixties, when she was influenced by the work
            of Kathie Sarachild, who had been a classmate of hers at Radcliffe, and who
            popularized the term &#8220;consciousness-raising.&#8221; She received her medical
            degree from Harvard University in 1968 with a cum laude distinction. <br><br>

            Herman became interested in the subject of violence
            against women and began to study that subject as she was finishing her residency
            in psychiatry, publishing a study on trauma with a young psychologist, Lisa
            Hirschman. She went on to develop her interest in all forms of domestic gender-based
            violence, publishing a study of incest, Father-Daughter Incest (Harvard University
            Press, 1981). In 1986, Judith Herman published an article with her mother who
            had done important studies on the shame reaction to trauma. (Judith Lewis Herman
            and Helen Block Lewis, 'Anger in the Mother&#8211;Daughter Relationship', The
            Psychology of Today's Woman: New Psychoanalytic Visions: Edited by Toni Bernay
            and Dorothy W. Cantor. Hillsdale, New Jersey: The Analytic Press. 1986). Herman
            spent 30 years as clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and
            Director of Training at the Victims of Violence Program at Cambridge Hospital, before retiring.
            As a Radcliffe Institute Fellow in 2001-2, Herman studied how survivors of violent
            crimes come to terms with those who have offended against them, focusing on
            the victims of child abuse, rape, and domestic violence that she long studied
            and treated. <br><br>

            Herman has lectured widely on these subjects and
            is the author of many award-winning publications, including Trauma and Recovery:
            The Aftermath of Violence from Domestic Abuse to Political Terror (Basic Books,
            1992). Among her numerous honors are a Lifetime Achievement Award from the International
            Society for Traumatic Stress Studies, a Bunting Institute fellowship from Radcliffe,
            a Women in Science Award from the American Medical Women's Association,
            and the Manfred S. Guttmacher Award from the American Psychiatric Association
            and American Academy of Psychiatry and Law. She received a Radcliffe Alumnae
            recognition award in June 2006.  She received a Guggenheim fellowship in 1984 and the 1996 Lifetime
            Achievement Award from the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies. 
            
            <Br><Br>In 2007
            Herman was named a Distinguished Life Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association.
                She is currently a Senior Lecturer in Psychiatry (part time) at
            Harvard Medical School. She is
            the author of the award-winning books Father-Daughter Incest (Harvard University
            Press, 1981), and Trauma and Recovery (Basic Books, 1992). 
            Her new book, <em>Truth and Repair: How Trauma Survivors Envision Justice</em>, was published
            in March, 2023. `,

            where she organized a group to represent the poor (Welfare Rights Organization).
            She then worked with the Episcopal Diocese in Philadelphia and began to advocate
            for women and the ordination of women priests. She organized and participated
            in the first women's ordination in July 29 1974, though they did not then
            have the permission of their bishops or the church government at that time.
            After the Episcopal Church's General Convention in 1976, where ordination of

            the John Seely Stone Professor of Pastoral Theology, Cambridge. 
            In 1989, she was residing at 101 Brattle Street in Cambridge. In 1997, she
            was Acting Director of Congregational Studies. The Suzanne Hiatt Chair in Feminist
            Pastoral Theology was named after her. In 1993, she published with Emily C Hewitt,
            <em>Women Priests, Yes or No?</em> She contributed extensive book chapters and
            articles on a variety of topics. She presented a woman for ordination of the

            instructor in comparative religion at Andover Theological Seminary, in Boston
            on June 28, 1905. They had three children, Richard Hocking (1906-2001), Hester
            Campbell (b. 1909), and Joan Kracke (b.1911). The couple moved to Berkeley, California,
            then to New Haven, Connecticut, and finally back to Cambridge in 1914, when William
            obtained positions in the philosophy departments of UC, Yale, and Harvard respectively.
            He was named Alford Professor of Natural Religion and Moral Philosophy in 1920. <br><br>
            William and Agnes Hocking founded the Cooperative Open-Air School in the
            spring
            of 1915 located at their home at 16 Quincy Street in Cambridge. Parents shared
            teaching duties and generally believed in teaching from primary sources, without
            textbooks, and encouraging children's exposure to plenty of fresh air in
            the classrooms. In 1917, the school moved to the Charles Eliot Norton estate
            near Shady Hill Square at the corner of Holden and Scott streets and adopted
            the name Shady Hill School around 1917-18. In October 1926, the school relocated
            to Coolidge Hill in Cambridge. The couple continued their strong interest in
            the project and correspondence with the directors until their deaths. <br><br>
            The correspondence of Agnes and her husband, and
            multiple letters from others concerning Shady Hill School and many other topics
            is to
            be found in the William Ernest
            Hocking papers in Houghton Library Harvard University and additional letters
            (about Shady Hill) in the Katherine Taylor Papers in Schlesinger Library. There

        narrative: `
            A widow, living in Cambridge, Winifred Holman,
            and her daughter Mary were accused in the summer of 1659 of witchcraft by a
            family living nearby. The neighbors included John Gibson, his wife, and their
            married daughter, Rebecca Stearns. Over some time previously, Rebecca began
            to experience unexplained fits in which she barked like a dog and screamed that
            Mrs. Holman and her daughter were witches. Her parents became alarmed and sought
            an explanation. 
            
            <br><Br>In an indictment they prepared, the Gibsons claimed that Winifred
            Holman had offered herbs to their daughter during a previous fit and noticed
            that the daughter, Rebecca, seemed worse whenever she saw the Holmans. They
            also cited some assistance by the Holmans to their daughter's child after
            the child had fallen ill that did not result in any improvement. <br><br>The indictment
            included observations on the behavior of Winifred Holman and her poultry, which
            the Gibsons considered peculiar, attributing the death of some of their own
            hens to witchcraft. This indictment could have had serious consequences since
            an unfortunate woman, Goody Kendal had been executed as a witch in Cambridge
            because of a claim by the nurse of a child that she had &#8220;made much of&#8221;
            a child and caused its sudden death.<br><br>
            In defense of her character as a &#8220;good Christian woman,&#8221; Mrs. Holman
            submitted certificates signed by two deacons and her neighbors that said she
            was diligent in attending church and had never been perceived to do or say anything
            or to give any grounds to suspect her of &#8220;witchery&#8221;. Without the
            hysteria that engulfed similar cases in Salem thirty years later, the case was
            dismissed. Mary and Winifred Holman then brought two suits in the county courts
            at the end of March 1660 against John Gibson and his daughter Rebecca Stearns
            for defamation. <br>

            Pauline Hopkins was born in Maine but came to
            Boston as a young girl where she attended Girls High School. After winning a
            writing competition at the age of fifteen sponsored by the African American
            playwright, novelist, essayist, historian, and abolitionist, William Wells Brown
            (1814-1884), she began to write seriously. <br><br>At the age of twenty, she wrote a
            musical drama &#8220;Slaves Escape or the Underground Railroad&#8221;. She both
            produced the play and performed a central role. In order to support herself,
            she worked as a stenographer with the Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics, beginning
            her professional literary career only in 1900 when she published a short story
            in the first issue of <em>The Colored American Magazine</em>. She wrote continuously
            for the magazine, eventually becoming its literary editor. Her work includes
            many short stories, essays, and two serialized novels: <em>Winona: A Tale of
                Negro Life in the South and Southwest</em> and <em>Of One Blood: or, The Hidden
                Self.</em> 
                
                <br><br>In 1902, Pauline Hopkins wrote:
            <blockquote>"Is it not true that the fate of the Negro is the romance of American History?"
            </blockquote>
            
            In 1903, in <i>Colored American Magazine</i>, Hopkins wrote of the complexities of racial issues at the time:<blockquote>
            "We grant that the Southern woman has given us a terrible blow, and in a vital part, because woman 
            is the natural social leader; she is responsible in great measure for society's deeds; but we
             have known for years where to seek our enemy; it is not the man so much as the environments of
              his social system. Granted that the conditions are hard for a certain class of Southern white
               women; but the results of profligacy are the same in any case, no matter whether white or 
               black are the partners. Certainly the rapid life of society everywhere at present, among 
               white and black, is not suggestive of absolute purity, and the black is no worse than his 
               environment; he follows the fashions as set by his white superior. <Br><br>
               
               "But if this thing be true, 
               and pity 'tis, 'tis true, it is but the result of conditions forced upon a helpless people, 
               and not their choice; we reap the whirlwind from sowing the wind. Meanwhile, tears and sorrow and
                heart-burning are the Southern white woman's portion, and like Sarah of old she wreaks her 
                vengeance on helpless Hagar. Club life has but rendered her disposition more intolerable toward
                 the victims of her husband's and son's evil passions.<Br><BR>
            "Spite of these sad short-comings, let us hope. Never until we welcome the Negro, the foreigner, 
            all races, as equals, and welded together in a common nationality, shall we deserve prosperity 
            and peace. We hope the time is not far distant when the women of African descent will meet in a 
            General Federation, and pray, with unwavering trust in the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of
             man: <Br><Br>'Lord, from the four corners of the world we have come to this convention, as representing the
              homes of the world. It is to these homes the effects of this meeting, for good or for evil, will 
              go. May many homes be made stronger and sweeter, may many crooked ways be made straight, by what
               we shall do and say here.'"
                </blockquote>
               
               In 1905, ill health forced Hopkins to return to work as a stenographer
             at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her final literary work was a series
            of articles entitled, &quot;Dark Races of the Twentieth Century,&quot; published
            during 1904-1905 in The Voice of the Negro. Mainly interested in the problems
            of the black middle class, she was one of the first black women writers in America. 
            <br><Br>She was living at 19 Jay Street in Cambridge at the time of her death.

            Cornelia Horsford was born in Cambridge, the daughter
            of Eben Norton Horsford, a professor of chemistry at the Lawrence Scientific
            School, Harvard University, and his second wife Phoebe (Gardiner). She lived on Kirkland Street and attended
            private schools in Cambridge and Boston. Her father, after making a fortune
            from the manufacture of baking powder, became an enthusiastic amateur archaeologist,
            convinced that Leif Erikson had landed in North America and resided along the
            Charles River. He purchased land and erected a tower and monument to this theory
            in Weston, Massachusetts, at the junction of the Charles and Stony Brook Rivers. Just before
            his death in 1893, he asked his daughter to carry on his work. <br><br>
            In subsequent years, Cornelia Horsford published his unfinished writings along
            with her own studies. In her essay &#8220;Graves of the Northmen,&#8221; published
            with her father's writings in 1893, Miss Horsford gave an interesting
            description of the supposed traces of Leif Ericson at Gerry's Landing,
            in Cambridge, first claimed by her father. She also organized archaeological
            expeditions in Iceland in 1895, in the British Isles, 1895, 1896, 1897; and
            directed investigations of the Norse discovery of America. She was the author
            of An Inscribed Stone, 1895; Ruins of the Saga-Time; and &#8220;a popular article
            &#8220;Vinland and its Ruins: Some of the evidence that Northmen were in Massachusetts
            in pre-Columbian days&#8221; Popular Science Monthly (December, 1899). Her later
            work was devoted mainly to the discovery of other similar ruins and her attempts
            to show that similar North American ruins were identical with those to be found
            in Iceland and Greenland. <br><br>
            Horsford was also a member of the Massachusetts Horticultural
            Society; Colonial Dames of Massachusetts; and the Icelandic Antiquarian Society.
            She lived in her family home at 27 Craigie Street, Cambridge and summered on
            Shelter Island, Long Island. Her family letters are in Rensselaer Polytechnic

            Lois
            Lilley Howe was born on September 25, 1864 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She
            was the eldest of four children of Dr. Estes and Lois Lilly (White) Howe. The
            family originally lived at 1 Oxford Street in Cambridge where they owned an
            acre of land and a few farm animals. Howe attended Miss Olmsted's and
            then Miss Page's elementary schools from 1868 &#8211; 1877 and graduated
            from the Cambridge public high school in 1882. From a young age, Howe showed
            an interest in architecture. The workers building the Sanders Theatre at Harvard
            College in 1876 dubbed her &#8220;the little superintendent&#8221; for her constant
            comments on their project. <br><br>

            From 1882 &#8211; 1886 Howe was a student at The
            School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Her focus at the Museum School was
            in design. Her later architectural work reflected this artistic training, and
            she maintained contacts with artists throughout her life. She became a member
            of the Copley Society of Boston, an association of artists, in 1883. <br><br>
            
            She joined
            the Council of the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in 1897; later the Museum
            School named her an annual &quot;Visitor to the School.&quot; She also served
            as director of the Boston Society of Arts and Crafts from 1916 to 1919.<br><Br>

            Howe's father passed away in 1887. Shortly after
            his death, the family sold the house on Oxford Street and moved to 2 Appleton
            Street. As a result of Howe's alteration of a stairway of the Oxford street
            home, which had been purchased by Reverend Francis G. Peabody, she gained the
            admiration of his brother and architect, Robert Swain Peabody, who became her
            mentor. <br><br>
            In 1888, Howe entered MIT's School of Architecture
            and took the two-year &#8220;Partial Architecture&#8221; course. During this
            time, she was a founding member of MIT's first woman student's group,
            Eta Sigma Mu (later known as Cleofan.) <br><br>
            Upon graduating from MIT in 1890, Howe worked
            as a drafter, artist and librarian in the Department of Architecture at MIT
            and for herself at the Boston architectural firm of Allen and Kenway. In 1893
            she submitted an application, on Allen and Kenway letterhead with a recommendation
            from Robert Peabody, to build the Woman's Building at the 1893 Chicago
            World's Fair. Her former MIT classmate Sophia
                Hayden also entered the competition. Hayden won and Howe placed second.
            Howe used the prize money for a long awaited trip to Europe.<br><br>
          
        </p>
        <p>After
            fifteen months abroad, Howe returned to America and began her practice at 73
            Tremont Street in Boston. She received her first commission to build a house
            in 1894, and worked alone and with various partners until 1900. She established
            her own firm in 1901 at 101 Tremont Street, Boston. <br><br>
            Also in 1901, Howe, sponsored again by Robert
            Peabody, became the second woman elected to the A.I.A. (American Institute of
            Architects). She was the first woman elected to the Boston Society of Architects.<br><br>
            Howe concentrated on domestic architecture from
            the beginning of her architectural career with an emphasis on history and detail.
            Noted projects of Howe's at this time were her 1901 and 1904 renovations
            of the Griswold residence at 23 Craigie Street in Cambridge. Howe was also noted
            for pioneering the use of stucco. Articles about her plasterwork appeared in
            <em>Architectural Review </em>and<em> Architectural Record</em>. In a 1907 issue
            of <em>Architectural Revew</em>, she gave advice about designing serving pantries
            for small houses. <br><br>
            In 1913 Howe co-published, with MIT graduate Constance
            Fuller, <em>Details of Old New England Houses</em>. Howe became known for her
            &#8220;ability to create simple, efficient floor plans; and her effort to minimize
            expense.&#8221; &#8220;Howe used to see the house being torn down and would
            run quickly and take the mantels and doors.&#8221;(Allaback).<br><br>
            Howe branched out in 1913 when she became partners
            with Eleanor Manning. Manning brought a concern for public housing and urban
            renewal to the firm. In the early 1920's Howe and Manning participated
            in the design of Mariemont, Ohio a planned community outside of Cincinnati using
            the principles of John Nolan and the English garden city as a model. They were
            also asked to submit designs by <em>McCall's </em>magazine for its small
            house series.<br><br>
            Howe and Manning further expanded in 1926 when
            they acquired a third partner, Mary Almy, like Howe, a native of Cambridge.
            This same year, the firm won first prize for The Charles Almy House in a Cape
            Code competition sponsored by <em>House Beautiful</em>.<br><br>
            Howe was active on several housing planning commissions
            throughout her life, but organizations concerned with housing problems represented
            only part of her activities. She supported women's educational opportunities
            as a member of the American Association of University Women and as the MIT representative
            for the General Committee of the &quot;Naples Table,&quot; which later became
            the Association to Aid Scientific Research by Women. Perhaps Howe's greatest
            honor came in 1931, when she became the first woman to achieve the status of
            Fellowship, an honor bestowed to some members of the A.I.A.<br><br>
            At the age of 73, Howe retired from Howe, Manning
            &amp; Almy in 1937, after practicing for more than forty years. After retirement,
            she occasionally worked on commissions for Eleanor O'Connor's private practice
            and was active in a number of Cambridge social clubs. <br><br>
            Lois Lilley Howe passed away in Cambridge on September
            13, 1964 just twelve days short of her hundredth birthday. She is buried at
            Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge.<br>

        narrative: `

        Audrey I-Wei Huang's parents, Ho-Chung and Hedy Huang, were born in China and grew up quite poor in Taiwan.  
        Yet they were both able to attend college in the United States on academic scholarships in the early 1960s, 
        following the lifting of eight decades of Chinese exclusion laws in this country. They both achieved advanced
         degrees in the U.S. and lived for a time in Ithaca, New York, where Audrey was born in 1967. <Br><br>

        Huang came to the Boston area to attend Boston University in the mid-1980s and in 1991 moved to West Cambridge,
         where she has lived ever since.  She found her first employment at the Addison-Wesley Publishing Company in Reading, 
         but felt the pull of public service and switched gears to attend Northeastern University School of Law, known
          for their public service focus and co-op programs.  Huang received her J.D. in 1994 and started practicing
          law in the Attorney General's office under AG Scott Harshbarger.  <Br><br>
        
        While at the AG's Office, she was an Assistant Attorney General, first focusing on family 
        and community crimes, doing victim compensation law. Soon thereafter, she became a Special 
        Assistant District Attorney for the Plymouth County District Attorney's Office and later 
        the Suffolk District Attorney's Office, helping get the <em>Safe Neighborhood Initiative</em> off the
         ground. She also worked in the Public Integrity Division, working on public corruption cases. 
         Later, she worked for the Middlesex and Suffolk District Attorney's Offices, as an Assistant
         District Attorney, focusing on crimes of domestic violence.  She also worked for the Middlesex 
         and Suffolk County DA's offices.  <Br><Br>Huang felt a call to make a difference in the communities she was 
         serving and enjoyed working with her like-minded and driven colleagues.  Huang says of her decision 
         to eschew private practice for lower-paying jobs in the public sector: "I'd always wanted to be 
         public service-oriented, community-oriented...it's overall a mission-driven career.  The mission 
         is basically for the public good."<br><br>
        
        In 2003, Huang decided to go into teaching law, first at Suffolk University Law School and then at
         Northeastern University.  In 2008, she returned to her focus on serving needy communities, working 
         for Greater Boston Legal Services, which provides free legal assistance and representation to residents 
         in Greater Boston.  At GBLS, she worked in the Asian Outreach Project, utilizing her Mandarin Chinese 
         abilities - a language she learned as a child from her parents - to help non-native speakers access the legal help they needed.
        <Br><br>
        After time off from work in the mid-2010s, Huang decided it was time for another major life change. 
         In late 2016, she followed her passion for reading to join the team that was soon to open Belmont 
         Books, a bookshop and cafe just a three-mile bike ride from her West Cambridge home.  
         As a frontline bookseller, Huang has learned a great deal about the book-selling process and 
         about publishing.  She says "I think books in general are more important than ever.  Especially 
         because overall within publishing, just like in Hollywood, it was a very whitewashed industry 
         where it was very difficult for authors of color and queer authors to essentially make it...what 
         I've done since I've been here is intersectional reading, but focused on BIPOC authors. And that's
          who I read and that's who I champion because they don't get as much recognition.”<Br><br>
        
        Huang's work has also included serving with the American Booksellers Association's (ABA) <i>Diversity 
        Equity and Inclusion Committee</i> (2021-present) and the NEIBA <i>Windows and Mirrors Committee</i> (2020-2021). 
         She was also the New England Independent Booksellers Association (NEIBA) <i>Handseller of the Year</i> (2024), 
         a Duende-Word <i>BIPOC Bookseller Award</i> Honoree (2024), an Andrew Carnegie <i>Medals of Excellence for Fiction 
         and Non-Fiction</i> Committee Member (2023), and an NEIBA Awards Committee Member (2020, 2022).<Br><br>
        
        Huang is an enthusiastic supporter and fan of the Cambridge Public Library system, including the 
        tiny Boudreau branch (named after Alma Boudreau, a member of the Cambridge Public Library board of 
        trustees for 57 years), less than a block from her home.  She also enjoys bike-riding and taking 
        in the ever-changing sights and sounds of Cambridge's Fresh Pond reservation.

        narrative: `
        Ruth Hubbard was a Harvard professor, scientist, and long time social activist.<blockquote>
        “Women and nonwhite, working-class and poor men have largely been outside the process of science-making.
        Though we have been described by scientists, by and 
        large we have not been the describers and definers of scientific reality. We have not formulated 
        the questions scientists ask, nor have we answered them. This undoubtedly has affected the content 
        of science, but it has also affected the social context and the ambience in which science is done.”
        <Br>- Ruth Hubbard, 1981
        </blockquote>
            Ruth Hubbard was born in Vienna, Austria and escaped
            the Nazi regime with her family when she thirteen. The family moved to the Boston
            area. Ruth attended Radcliffe College, graduating in 1945. She went on to study
            biochemistry and biology at Harvard. Entering George Wald's laboratory
            at Harvard, she did important work on the biochemistry of the visual system,
            working out the enzymatic interconversion of retinal and retinol for her PhD
            in 1950. <br><br>After receiving fellowships that took her to London and Copenhagen,
            she returned to Harvard. She married Wald in 1958 with whom she had a daughter
            and a son (they lived at 21 Lake View Avenue). The couple was awarded the Paul Karrer Medal from the University
            of Zurich for studies of biochemistry of vertebrates and invertebrates in 1967.
            After George Wald was awarded the Nobel prize in 1967, he became deeply concerned
            with issues of peace, in which Ruth joined him.<br><br>

            She was tenured as professor of biology at Harvard
            in 1974, the first woman tenured in the department. 
            
             Hubbard was an outspoken activist, insisting on questioning science's relationship to society, 
             protesting against U.S. involvement in foreign wars, and joining many other antinuclear activist
             in the fight for disarmament; she was once arrested on charges of civil disobedience.<br><Br>
            In the late seventies and
            early eighties, she created innovative courses on biology and politics from
            a feminist perspective. She began to publish studies of the politics of women's
            health, on the position of women in academia and research and
            on the ethics of gene therapy and genetic testing including, <em>The Politics
                of Women's Biology</em> (1990); <em>Profitable Promises: Essays on Women
                Science and Health</em> (1994); and <em>Exploding the Gene Myth,</em> with her
            son Elijah Wald, (1993). She was a board member of Science for the People in
            the 1970s and 1980s, along with geneticists Richard Lewontin and Jonathan Beckwith.
            She is a founding board member of The Council for Responsible Genetics.
            <Br><Br> Retiring
            in 1990, she became professor <em>emerita</em> in the Department of Molecular
            and Cellular Biology at Harvard. In 2003, she was awarded an honorary Doctorate
            of Science by Clark University. In May 2005, the Massachusetts American Civil
            Liberties Union presented her with the Luther Knight Macnair award for her work
            on bioethics.

        narrative: `
            Anna Vaughn Hyatt was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
            daughter of Audella (Beebe) and Alpheus Hyatt. They lived at 7 Avon Street. Her father was a curator of fossil
            invertebrates at Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard, professor of paleontology
            and zoology at MIT and a founder of Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratories.
            Through her father, she developed an interest in animals and animal anatomy.
            She was educated in private schools in Cambridge. <br><br>She began to study sculpture
            in Boston and then went to New York to study at the Arts Students League in
            the early 1900s. She began to observe animals at zoos and circuses. Her first
            exhibition was at the Boston Arts Club in 1900 and she soon became nationally
            known. From 1906 to 1910 she lived and worked in France and Italy, exhibiting
            her animal statues and an equestrian statue of Joan of Arc at the Paris Salon.
            She returned to New York where she prepared a public statue of Joan of Arc,
            and a wall statue for the Cathedral of St John the Divine. In 1923, she married
            Archer Milton Huntington, the adopted son of a railroad tycoon, who from this
            time on supported her work. The couple joined in philanthropic projects for
            museums and in the preservation of wildlife, funding more than fourteen museums
            and setting up an outdoor sculpture museum for American sculpture at Brookgreen
            Gardens, South Carolina. <br><br>
            In 1940, she and her husband moved to an estate, Stenerigg,
            in Redding Ridge Connecticut where she continued set up a large studio. There
            both husband and wife practiced organic farming and founded a bird sanctuary.
            After the death of her husband in 1955, she began a large number animal studies
            as well as monumental equestrian statues, the last completed when she was ninety.
            She died at the age of ninety seven at her estate, which is now the Collis P.
            Huntington State Park. <br><br>
           <i> Art News</i> ran a 2014 article on the Columbia University's Wallach Art Gallery's exhhhibit “Goddess, 
            Heroine, Beast: Anna Hyatt Huntington's New York Sculpture, 1902-1936,” which helped to reintroduce 
            her art to the public:
            <blockquote>
            "During her lifetime, the artist made a name for herself depicting fierce creatures, strong leaders, 
            and legendary heroines. Nearly a century later, this exhibition identifies Huntington as a powerful 
            figure in her own right. 'She succeeded in every way against every odd,' says [Barnard professor 
            Anne] Higgonet. 'And that's a lesson for women and a lesson for anyone who thinks they can't become an artist.'"

        narrative: `
        Born in Boston in 1886, Marjorie Hurd
            was the daughter of Alfred Dennis Hurd and Louisa Maria (Coolidge) Hurd. Her
            father worked in publishing and insurance; her mother was an incorporator of
            the Salem Woman's Club when the family moved to Salem, Massachusetts in
            1896. Marjorie's early influences included her paternal grandfather, Melancthon
            Montgomery Hurd, whose publishing company, Hurd &amp; Houghton, evolved into
            today's Houghton Mifflin Company; her maternal grandfather, Horace Hopkins
            Coolidge, a leading Boston attorney and president of the Massachusetts Senate;
            and her uncle William Williamson Coolidge, an attorney and mountain climber.
           <br><Br> As a girl, Marjorie attended the school kept by Bertha Hazard and Elizabeth
            J. Woodward in Boston's Back Bay, &#8220;Miss B. M. Howe's&#8221;
            Hamilton Hall School on Salem's Chestnut Street, and Salem High School.

            <br><br>She entered Radcliffe College in Cambridge as a member of the Class of 1908
            to study history and economics. Her yearbook motto was: &#8220;I am not daunted,
            no; I will engage.&#8221;
             After graduating from Radcliffe, Marjorie became
            involved in social service work. She returned to her alma mater in 1910 to pursue
            an advanced degree, earning
            her A.M. in government and economics. That same year, Marjorie and her family
            moved to 44 Walker Street, Cambridge. She also took the civil service examination,
            and received the highest percentage among her fellow test-takers. Marjorie's
            first job was as a &#8220;special agent&#8221; for the Massachusetts Minimum
            Wage Commission, where she began a lifelong professional relationship with the
            Women's Educational and Industrial Union in Boston (WEIU). <br><br>
            
            She also studied
            statistics with Professor William Z. Ripley at Harvard from 1912-13, and in
            1915 she was one of nine students to enroll in the first graduate level law
            school for women in America&#8212;the Cambridge Law School for Women, which
            was founded in 1915 by Professor Joseph H. Beale of the Harvard Law School.
            At the same time, Marjorie worked in the afternoons for the Cambridge Social
            Union (the precursor to today's Cambridge Center for Adult Education),
            and she was elected to the prestigious Phi Beta Kappa. Unfortunately, the law
            school was short-lived but, undaunted, Marjorie took courses at the Portia School
            of Law on Boston's Beacon Hill&#8212;the first law school in the country
            to admit women with or without a college degree. 
            
            <br><br>She also worked as a legal
            clerk for the law firm of Hale &amp; Dorr. In 1918, at the age of 32, Marjorie
            was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar. Between 1919 and 1920, she worked for
            the law firm of Dunbar, Nutter &amp; McClennen, and in 1920, Marjorie joined
            the staff of the Boston Legal Aid Society (BLAS) as its first female attorney.
            She remained there for 35 years. That same year, the family moved to 4 Mercer
            Circle, Cambridge, just off Brattle Street.
   <br><br>
       Along
            with her distinguished law career, Marjorie was an avid mountain climber, rock
            climber, camper, canoeist, swimmer and snowshoe-r. She traveled all over the
            world, climbing the Matterhorn, Mont Blanc, and the more difficult Dolomites;
            she also scaled every 4,000-link-to-top in the White Mountains (celebrating her 80th
            birthday on the summit of Mount Washington), and knew well the peaks in the
            Canadian Rockies and Sierra Nevada. The <em>Christian Science Monitor</em> once
            described her as a &#8220;petite sportswoman&#8221; as she stood less than five
            feet tall. When she was at home in Cambridge, Marjorie was an active volunteer
            including for the Appalachian Mountain Club (editor, officer, life member),
            Women's Travel Club, Massachusetts Bar Association, Massachusetts Association
            of Women Lawyers (serving as vice president and president), Business Women's
            Club, Cambridge Civic Association, Cambridge League of Women Voters (which met
            in her home at 4 Mercer Circle), and, late in life, the Mount Auburn Hospital
            Coffee Shop. <br><br>She was an active Radcliffe alumna and a member of the First Parish
            in Cambridge, Unitarian. Marjorie never married, but she was devoted to her
            brother Jack's three sons and one daughter, Lydia, in whose education
            Marjorie took a special interest. Marjorie made it possible for Lydia to attend
            Buckingham School, Radcliffe College (for two degrees), and the Harvard School
            of Education. Lydia Hurd earned an Ed.D. from Harvard and went on to found the
            Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program at Simmons College in Boston.<br><br>
            Marjorie died in 1977 at the age of 90 and was
            buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery. During the memorial service held for her at
            First Parish, Marjorie's friend Christine Reid noted, &#8220;her infectious
            laugh, her quick wit, her keen, incisive, legally trained mind, and her overflowing
            enthusiasm for the many and varied activities in which she participated won
            her countless friends and admirers during her long and productive life. Her
            sometimes brusque manner concealed her warm and generous heart, and she will
            be long remembered with deep admiration by those of us who were privileged to
            have known her.&#8221;`,
