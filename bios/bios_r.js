        narrative: `
            Margret Rey was born Margarete Elisabeth Waldstein
            in Germany. She studied at the Klosterschule in Hamburg where she graduated
            in 1925. She continued her studies in art at several schools including the Bauhaus
            in Dessau, Germany. She had a one-woman show of her watercolor paintings in
            Berlin. In 1929, she began working as a copywriter in for an English advertising
            company in Berlin. Also trained as a photographer, she took writing, advertising,
            and photography jobs in Germany and England. She traveled to Rio de Janerio,
            Brazil, in 1935, where she became reaquainted with the German-born Hans A. Reysenbach
            (later shortened to Rey), who was a family friend. Hans A. Rey had been working
            in Brazil since the mid 1920s in a family import business.<br><Br>
             The couple married in 1935, and moved to Paris where
            they began their collaboration in children's books. A French publisher became
            interested in Hans' drawings and commissioned him to write a children's
            book, published as <em>Rafi and the Nine Monkeys</em> which included a curious
            monkey that was the inspiration of the future children's book <em>Curious
                George</em>. <Br><Br>In 1940, the Reys fled Paris before the advancing Nazi army invaded.<Br><Br>
                She spoke about this in a 1996 <i>Christian Science Monitor</i> interview, 
                after Rey had turned 90 years old and several months before her death:
                <blockquote>
            "We left Paris very early the next morning. That was the only sad moment I remember. Nobody was in the streets,
             and it was gray and dark. After we left, it was fine. We bicycled. We were lucky.

            People who had a car would be stopped because another car broke down miles ahead. So when one car 
            broke down, it was terrible. But bicycles could always get by. We kept going south, and we slept 
            in barns. You know, when you're in action you're not scared. When you're sitting and waiting for 
            something, that's the unpleasant situation."

                            </blockquote>
            The couple traveled to via Spain and Portugal, then back to Brazil and from there
            to New York City, taking the illustrated manuscript of the new book they had
            just written. <em>Curious George</em> was published by Houghton Mifflin in 1941.
            Together, the Reys wrote seven books about the curious little monkey, with Hans
            doing the most of the illustrations and Margret working primarily on the stories.
            Though they shared much of the work, Margret's name did not appear on the books
            for the first several
            years, but this was corrected in later editions. They published other children's
            stories including <em>Pretzel</em> in 1944, which was the first book to list
            Margret as author.<br><Br>

            In 1963, Margret Rey and her husband moved to
            Cambridge and settled in a home near Harvard Square at 14 Hilliard Street. Hans died in in 1977. Soon
            after, Margret was approached by Alan Shallek who persuaded her to collaborate
            on a series of short films for television that began to appear on the Disney
            Channel in 1980. Margret contined to write and teach. In 1979, she was appointed
            at Brandeis University as a professor of Creative Writing.<Br><Br> In 1989, she established
            the Curious George Foundation to benefit children's creativity and animal and
            environmental welfare. Rey was also a long-time supporter of Longy School of
            Music and founded a center of alternative medicine at Beth Israel Hospital.
            She died on December 21, 1996 at the age of ninety, ten years before PBS began
            its new series of programs based on Curious George. Donna Friedman and Hillel
            Stavis opened the Curious George Goes to Wordsworth store at the corner of Brattle
            and J.F.K. streets in the summer of 1996. Rey visited the store and was apparently
            pleased with the idea for the Curious George themed store, which sells children's
            books and toys. <Br><Br>The de Grummond Children's Literature Collection at the

            She was educated at the University of Denver and obtained her doctorate in psychology
            from Columbia University in 1933. Although working as a clinical psychologist,
            Roe accompanied her husband on some of his field expeditions to Venezuela, helping
            to collect mammals for the American Museum of Natural History. When they moved
            to Cambridge and her husband took up a position at Harvard's Museum of Comparative

        narrative: `
            Anne
            Roorbach was born on March 30, 1882 in the farming community of West Huntingdon,
            Ontario, Canada to George Taylor Hubble and Matilda Catherine Ashley Hubble.
            Anne attended Syracuse University on a scholarship, graduating cum laude in
            1903 with a Bachelor of Philosophy degree. She taught English at several high
            schools in upstate New York and afterwards moved to Philadelphia where she taught
            at William Penn High School.<br><Br>

             Anne Hubble pursued graduate studies at Radcliffe College
            in 1910-11, and in 1912 she married George Byron Roorbach, an instructor at
            the University of Pennsylvania. Soon after, George Roorbach was made Professor
            of Commercial Geography at the university. The couple raised four children (three
            girls and a boy) in Philadelphia until the First World War, at which time George
            Roorbach joined the U.S. Shipping Board,and later a
            Professor of Trade at the Harvard Business School. In 1919, the family moved
            to 16 Kirkland Street in Cambridge, where another son and daughter were born. George
            Roorbach died suddenly from a heart attack on May 23, 1934, while in Washington,
            D.C.<br><Br>
             While
            living in Cambridge, Anne Roorbach became very active in civic affairs. By 1930,
            she was an officer in the Cambridge League of Women Voters and subsequently
            served in various positions as Committee Chair, Director, and Vice President
            until 1950. She joined the Cambridge Tax Payers Association, led by Grace
                Johnson and others, which worked to reform Cambridge city government by
            introducing proportional representation (Plan E form of government), a change
            that was voted into law in 1940 and finally instituted in 1942. In 1945, with
            continued challenges to Plan E, the association became the Cambridge Civic Association,
            within which, as an active member, Roorbach served as a mentor to young women,
            among them Pearl Wise, who went on to play
            a significant role in city government. <br><Br>
             In addition to her political work, Anne Roorbach served
            as a director of the Cambridge YWCA, and was
            instrumental in the installation of a swimming pool in the facility. She was
            an active member of the Cambridge Historical Society and also served the Unitarian
            church, the First Unitarian Church (now the First Parish Church, Unitarian Universalist),
            as deacon and as the chair of various committees. She was interested in the
            Harvard museums, and published a short article on the glass flower collection
            in 1937.<br><Br>
             Throughout
            her life, Anne Roorbach was an ardent believer in women's rights and conveyed
            those beliefs to her six children, E. Howard, Elizabeth H., Carolyn R. (Dunbar),
            Anne R. (Wallace), Jean A. (Domovs), and George Brett. The family lived in several
            homes in Cambridge including 86 Sparks Street and 74 Avon Hill Street. Her residence
            was 8 Craigie Circle, in Cambridge, when she died on March 1, 1964 at the age of
            eighty-two.`,

            Betty Ann Rubinow (who went by "Ann") was the daughter
            of Meyer and Beverley Orlov in Brookline, Massachusetts. She attended Bryn Mawr College,
            then came to Cambridge in the 1950s to do graduate work in history at Harvard
            University. During this period, she became active in civil rights in Cambridge
            and was a founder of the Boston chapter of the Episcopal Society for Cultural
            and Racial Unity. She went to Selma, Alabama, to march with Martin Luther King, Jr.
            Her home in Cambridge at 1 Potter Park became a center for educational and welfare reform.
            
            <Br><Br>In 2007, Reverend Constance Parvey of Cambridge, who had known her since the 1950's,
             described Ann's involvement in civil rights activities in the late 1950s and 1960s:
            <blockQuote>
            "Ann [was always] making sure people got to know each other. Not just 'This is so-and-so', but 
            'What are we going to do about this?' Ann was not someone who started with the weather. She started 
            out with what was absolutely on her mind. It was a heady time. It was a time when we were remapping 
            the theological and social landscape."
            </blockquote> From
            1968 to 1975, she left graduate work to become an editor for behavioral studies
            at the Harvard University Press. In 1974 she and Stephan Thernstrom developed
            the idea of creating the<em> Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups </em>(1980), of which she became
            managing editor. She started her own press,
            Langdon Press, after leaving Harvard University Press, and worked as a free-lance
            author and consultant. <br><Br>
            In 1980, she moved to Stowe, Vermont, and opened a
            bed and breakfast. Soon after, she was diagnosed with a benign brain tumor that
            left her with a slight limp. There in Vermont, she worked with the Episcopal
            church and decided to pursue a theological degree, which she began in Vermont
            and completed at the Jesuit Faculty of Theology at Regis College in Toronto;
            she received her M. Div. there in 1996. In 2002, she reconnected with an old
            boyfriend from her adolescence, Dr. Merrill Rubinow; they married soon after.
            The couple moved to Tucson, Arizona. <Br><Br>Dr. Rubinow died there four years later, seven
            months before Orlov's own death. `,
