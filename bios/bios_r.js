        narrative: `
            Margret Rey was born Margarete Elisabeth Waldstein
            in Germany. She studied at the Klosterschule in Hamburg where she graduated
            in 1925. She continued her studies in art at several schools including the Bauhaus
            in Dessau, Germany. She had a one-woman show of her watercolor paintings in
            Berlin. In 1929, she began working as a copywriter in for an English advertising
            company in Berlin. Also trained as a photographer, she took writing, advertising,
            and photography jobs in Germany and England. She traveled to Rio de Janerio,
            Brazil, in 1935, where she became reaquainted with the German-born Hans A. Reysenbach
            (later shortened to Rey), who was a family friend. Hans A. Rey had been working
            in Brazil since the mid 1920s in a family import business.<br><Br>
             The couple married in 1935, and moved to Paris where
            they began their collaboration in children's books. A French publisher became
            interested in Hans' drawings and commissioned him to write a children's
            book, published as <em>Rafi and the Nine Monkeys</em> which included a curious
            monkey that was the inspiration of the future children's book <em>Curious
                George</em>. <Br><Br>In 1940, the Reys fled Paris before the advancing Nazi army invaded.
            They traveled to via Spain and Portugal, then back to Brazil and from there
            to New York City, taking the illustrated manuscript of the new book they had
            just written. <em>Curious George</em> was published by Houghton Mifflin in 1941.
            Together, the Reys wrote seven books about the curious little monkey, with Hans
            doing the most of the illustrations and Margret working primarily on the stories.
            Though they shared much of the work, Margret's name did not appear on the books
            for the first several
            years, but this was corrected in later editions. They published other children's
            stories including <em>Pretzel</em> in 1944, which was the first book to list
            Margret as author.<br><Br>
            In 1963, Margret Rey and her husband moved to
            Cambridge and settled in a home near Harvard Square. Hans died in in 1977. Soon
            after, Margret was approached by Alan Shallek who persuaded her to collaborate
            on a series of short films for television that began to appear on the Disney
            Channel in 1980. Margret contined to write and teach. In 1979, she was appointed
            at Brandeis University as a professor of Creative Writing. In 1989, she established
            the Curious George Foundation to benefit children's creativity and animal and
            environmental welfare. Rey was also a long-time supporter of Longy School of
            Music and founded a center of alternative medicine at Beth Israel Hospital.
            She died on December 21, 1996 at the age of ninety, ten years before PBS began
            its new series of programs based on Curious George. Donna Friedman and Hillel
            Stavis opened the Curious George Goes to Wordsworth store at the corner of Brattle
            and J.F.K. streets in the summer of 1996. Rey visited the store and was apparently
            pleased with the idea for the Curious George themed store, which sells children's
            books and toys. <Br><Br>The de Grummond Children's Literature Collection at the

            Ellen Swallow was born in the small town of Dunstable,
            MA to Fanny and Peter Swallow. She attended Westford Academy in Westford, MA,
            graduating in 1863. After studying and then teaching in Worcester, she went
            to Vassar College, which had just opened at an advanced level, graduating in
            1870. She then had the opportunity to attend the Massachusetts Institute of
            Technology as a special student, the first woman to be accepted at any scientific
            school. In 1873, she received a second bachelor's degree from MIT and
            a master's degree from Vassar. She continued to study at MIT and to work
            under John Nichols on practical problems, such as water safety for the state.
            In 1873 she married Robert Hallowell Richards, a professor of mining engineering
            at MIT. <br><Br>
            With the help of the Women's Education Association
            of Boston, Ellen Richards established a Woman's Laboratory at MIT in 1876
            under the directorship of John M. Ordway, which offered training to women in
            a wide range of sciences; Richards was named an instructor at the laboratory.
            When women were admitted as MIT undergraduates to regular laboratories in 1883,
            the women's laboratory closed. Richards was then appointed an instructor
            in sanitary chemistry and continued to work in the field of sanitation and home
            economics (a field she helped establish) until her death. She also created a

            Anne
            Roorbach was born on March 30, 1882 in the farming community of West Huntingdon,
            Ontario, Canada to George Taylor Hubble and Matilda Catherine Ashley Hubble.
            Anne attended Syracuse University on a scholarship, graduating cum laude in
            1903 with a Bachelor of Philosophy degree. She taught English at several high
            schools in upstate New York and afterwards moved to Philadelphia where she taught
            at William Penn High School.<br><Br>
             Anne Hubble pursued graduate studies at Radcliffe College
            in 1910-11, and in 1912 she married George Byron Roorbach, an instructor at
            the University of Pennsylvania. Soon after, George Roorbach was made Professor
            of Commercial Geography at the university. The couple raised four children (three
            girls and a boy) in Philadelphia until the First World War, at which time George
            Roorbach joined the U.S. Shipping Board, a part of the Department of Commerce
            in Washington, D.C. Following the war, he was offered a position as the first
            Professor of Trade at the Harvard Business School, continuing also to consult
            for the government on Reciprocal Trade Agreements. In 1919, the family moved
            to Cambridge, Massachusetts where another son and daughter were born. George
            Roorbach died suddenly from a heart attack on May 23, 1934, while in Washington,
            D.C.<br><Br>
             While
            living in Cambridge, Anne Roorbach became very active in civic affairs. By 1930,
            she was an officer in the Cambridge League of Women Voters and subsequently
            served in various positions as Committee Chair, Director, and Vice President
            until 1950. She joined the Cambridge Tax Payers Association, led by Grace
                Johnson and others, which worked to reform Cambridge city government by
            introducing proportional representation (Plan E form of government), a change
            that was voted into law in 1940 and finally instituted in 1942. In 1945, with
            continued challenges to Plan E, the association became the Cambridge Civic Association,
            within which, as an active member, Roorbach served as a mentor to young women,
            among them Pearl Wise, who went on to play
            a significant role in city government. <br><Br>
             In addition to her political work, Anne Roorbach served
            as a director of the Cambridge YWCA, and was
            instrumental in the installation of a swimming pool in the facility. She was
            an active member of the Cambridge Historical Society and also served the Unitarian
            church, the First Unitarian Church (now the First Parish Church, Unitarian Universalist),
            as deacon and as the chair of various committees. She was interested in the
            Harvard museums, and published a short article on the glass flower collection
            in 1937.<br><Br>
             Throughout
            her life, Anne Roorbach was an ardent believer in women's rights and conveyed
            those beliefs to her six children, E. Howard, Elizabeth H., Carolyn R. (Dunbar),
            Anne R. (Wallace), Jean A. (Domovs), and George Brett. The family lived in several
            homes in Cambridge including 86 Sparks Street and 74 Avon Hill Street. Her residence
            was 8 Craigie Circle, Cambridge when she died on March 1, 1964 at the age of
            eighty-two.`,

            and was a founder of the Boston chapter of the Episcopal Society for Cultural
            and Racial Unity. She went to Selma, AL, to march with Martin Luther King, Jr.
            <br><Br>Her home in Cambridge became a center for educational and welfare reform. From
            1968 to 1975, she left graduate work to become an editor for behavioral studies
            at the Harvard University Press. In 1974 she and Stephan Thernstrom developed
            the idea of creating the<em> Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups </em>(1980), of which she became
