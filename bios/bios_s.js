        title: `Factory worker, educator, counselor, community leader`,

        narrative: `
            Born in Chile, Sylvia Saavedra-Keber finished
            the first three years of college, and then planned to work in southern Chile
            with the poor and disenfranchised. When Salvadore Allende's socialist
            government was overthrown, Sylvia's parents were concerned for her safety,
            and she emigrated from Chile to the United States in 1970. <br><Br>

            After arriving in Watertown, Massachusetts, she worked at
            factory jobs: first, she spent a year at Fenton Shoe in Cambridgeport, gluing
            shoe soles with a hot glue that aggravated her asthma; then she worked at Fanny
            Farmer, breaking up pieces of warm chocolate. As this also began to affect her
            health, she left the company and was trained for professional work through the
            Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) programs. After CETA, she taught
            at Bunker Hill Community College and was later the head of affirmative action
            for the Massachusetts Department of Employment and Training. <br><Br>

            In the late 1970s, Sylvia began her career in
            Cambridge as a bilingual youth employment counselor at the city's Economic
            Opportunity Commission. She became a board member of Concilio Hispano in Cambridge
            (the area's Latino community resource center), which was established in
            1967. Sylvia credits Mayor Alfred Vellucci, an immigrant himself, as the main
            force behind the founding of Concilio. After seven years on the board, she became
            president. Around 1997, a member of the board recruited her to become the executive
            director. Sylvia also helped create the Commission of Latino Affairs for the
            City of Cambridge. In September 2000, she received the Beryl H. Bunker Award.
            <br><Br>

            Sylvia Saavedra-Keber describes the purpose of Concilio:<blockquote> &#8220;As Latinos at
            Concilio, we are trying to build human beings [who are] independent from the
            system, from welfare, from anyone, because we might not be here tomorrow. We
            have to create independence rather than dependency around our service.&#8221;</blockquote>
            
            <br>
            Sylvia has spoken about her feelings about being
            an immigrant: <blockquote>&#8220;The pain that you always carry as an immigrant about not
            being born here, you will always carry it...You will always miss that comfort
            that you have about being born in your own country. You are never going to feel
            one hundred percent part of it...I think at some point you have to let go. That
            is the point which is so important for you as an immigrant, to really continue
            to contribute to your society here.&#8221;</blockquote>

        deathDate: "07.16.1995",
        deathLocation: "York, Maine",
        narrative: `
            May Sarton was born Eleanore Marie Sarton, the
            daughter of George Sarton, a historian of science, and his Welsh wife, Eleanor
            Mabel Elwes. In 1915, at the beginning of the World War I, the Sarton family
            fled from Belgium to England. <Br><Br>
            
            After a few peripatetic years in the States, George
            Sarton accepted an appointment at Harvard University, which led the family to
            settle in Cambridge, in 1918. May attended Shady Hill School, where she began
            writing poetry. When her family moved back to Belgium for a few years, May attended
            the Institute Belge de Culture Fran&ccedil;aise in Brussels. On returning to
            Cambridge and settling with her parents on Channing Place, May attended Cambridge
            High and Latin School. <br><Br>
            After graduating from high school in 1929, May
            studied in New York at the Civic Repertory Theater. She returned to Boston,
            where she taught creative writing and choral speaking, and directed plays at
            the old Stuart School in the Fenway. She also lectured on poetry at the Winsor
            School and Milton Academy. Her first book, <em>Encounter in April</em>, was
            published in 1937, and a year later she published <em>The Single Hound</em>.
            Sarton at first wanted to be an actress, and spent the years 1927-ca.1935 at
            the New York Civic Repertory Theater and in Paris. When she proved unsuccessful
            as an actress, she turned to writing fiction. Her first short stories did not
            sell, and in 1936 she moved to London where she met the poet Elizabeth Bowen,
            who was to become a passionate friend and lover for the next decades. <br><Br>
            May Sarton began to write poetry seriously and
            in 1939 returned to the United States. Her collection of poems, <em>Inner Landscape</em>,
            was published that year, and she began to earn her living lecturing and giving
            poetry readings at various colleges and schools. During World War II, she worked
            for the Office of War Information in the film department. In 1945, she won the
            Gold Rose for Poetry and the Edward Bland Memorial prize. After the war, with
            publication of the novel, <em>The Bridge of Years</em>, and a poetry collection,
            The <em>Lion and the Rose</em> (1948), Sarton's reputation began to grow.
            Her short stories were published in <em>The New Yorker</em> and <em>Harper's
                Bazaar</em>, and she wrote several articles for the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>,
            <em>Harper's</em>, <em>The Kenyan Review</em>, <em>The Reporter</em>,
            and others. She supported herself by teaching in universities from 1950 to 1955,
            serving as Briggs-Copeland instructor in composition at Harvard from 1950 to
            1952. In 1954 he wrote a biography of her father, <em>I Knew a Phoenix</em>,
            depicting Cambridge and the academic world in which she grew up. <br><Br>
            After 1958, when both her parents died, she sold
            her family home in Cambridge and moved to Nelson, New Hampshire, where she wrote
            <em>The Small Room</em> and <em>Mrs. Stevens Hears the Mermaids Singing</em>.
            Because this second book depicted a lesbian affair, she was required to excise
            some passages before her publisher would agree to accept it. This book is considered
            the author's most intense study of the feminine artist as a misunderstood
            and solitary individual. Sarton lectured at Harvard, Radcliffe, and Wellesley
            colleges, and many other educational institutions. She was a Guggenheim fellow
            in poetry and a fellow in poetry at Bryn Mawr College, and was awarded honorary
            degrees from the University of New Hampshire, Clark University, and Colby, Bates,
            and Russell Sage colleges. She held the Golden Rose Award for poetry, the Edward
            Bland Memorial Prize from Poetry Magazine, the Reynolds Lyric Award of the Poetry
            Society of America, the Alexandrine Medal of the College of St. Catherine, and
            the Perkins Memorial Award of Eastern Connecticut's Thoreau School of
            Holistic Education. <br><Br>
            In 1973, Sarton moved to New York. Later, she
            published two autobiographies, <em>Plant Dreaming Deep</em> and <em>A World
                of Light</em>, published in 1968 and 1976, respectively. In the 1980s, she suffered
            a stroke, which left her unable to write for over nine months; later she published,
            <em>After the Stroke</em> (1988). A year before her death, May published a last
            volume of poems, <em>Coming into Eighty</em> (1994). She died of breast cancer
            on Sunday, July 17, 1993, in York Hospital, Maine. <br>
            Sarton published more than fifty books of poetry, memoirs, novels, and essays.
            <Br><Br>In 1982, the first comprehensive scholarly look at her work, <em>May Sarton:
                Woman and Poet</em> by Constance Hunting, was published by the National Poetry
            Foundation. In 1996, a plaque commemorating her life and work, was erected on
            the grounds of the main branch of the Cambridge Public Library. `,

            <em>Snatched From Oblivion</em>, that described growing up in an academic household
            in Cambridge dominated by strong-minded women, including her novelist mother.

            Mary Shea was a wife, mother, and grandmother,
            as well as a childcare teacher and tireless activist for affordable housing
            and tenants' rights. <br><Br>
            When Mary Shea joined the Simplex Steering Committee,
            which pressured MIT to include affordable housing and parks in the development
            of the former Simplex site, she had a personal stake in the fight. Her father
            had worked at the Simplex Wire &amp; Cable Company for twenty years and contracted
            silicosis (chalk on the lungs) on the job. 
            
            <Br><Br>In 1946 Mary had married, and she
            and her husband moved to her father's house, where Mary cared for him.
            She said, <blockquote>&#8220;That's when I decided if there was anything I had to
            do in my life, it was going to be helping people have a better life, rather
            than seeing someone come out of a garage all full of chalk and ready to die.&#8221;</blockquote>

            After her father passed away and her children grew up, Mary organized with people

            Mary explained that everyone in the Cambridgeport
            neighborhood was affiliated with the fight against the conflicting plans developed
            by MIT, the owner of the Simplex property. Mary, her daughter Nancy, and Nancy's
            daughter, Jillian, picketed at an M.I.T. graduation. Although the Simplex Steering
            Committee obtained some affordable housing concessions from M.I.T., when the
            City of Cambridge approved MIT's proposals in 1988, many activists, including
            Mary, agreed that this was not enough after 18 years of protests.<br><br>
            She cared for her neighbors, shopping and doing errands, giving money to homeless people,

        <p> E. Denise Simmons is a lifelong resident of Cambridge. Simmons was one of only
            two African American students during her nine years at St. Mary&rsquo;s, a parochial school in Cambridge,
            before entering the public school system, which was much more diverse. She graduated from Cambridge High and
            Latin in 1971. Simmons went on to receive a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology from the University of
            Massachusetts Boston, followed by a Master&rsquo;s Degree in Psychotherapy from Antioch College. In 2009,
            she earned her honorary PhD from the Episcopal Divinity School. <br><br>
             In the early 1980s, Simmons was hired as the executive director of the Cambridge
            Civic Unity Committee, an organization formed in 1945 to help WWII veterans facing racial discrimination
            after returning from service. The Committee&rsquo;s ongoing mission was to promote equality and unity across
            racial and religious lines and addressing civic issues like community-police relations, employment,
            education and housing. In 1982, concerned about job stability and providing for her children, Simmons
            started her own small business, the Cambridgeport Insurance Agency, which has operated for over thirty five
            years.  In 2018, that agency became affiliated with Allstate Insurance Company. <br><br>
             Passionate about her civic work, Simmons decided that she could affect more change
            in municipal governance and ran for local office in the early 1990s, losing two times before winning a seat
            on the School Committee in 1991. Simmons was a strong advocate for minority representation in Cambridge,
            pushing for more teachers of color, expanded opportunities for students of color, increasing literacy across
            the city and helping non-English speaking families. She worked to institute the family engagement policy,
            which mandated that the Cambridge Schools administrators promote, increase, and implement family involvement
            in their children&rsquo;s educational experience. The policy is still in effect. <br><br>
             In 2001, Simmons successfully ran for a seat on the Cambridge City Council, and in
            2008, she was unanimously elected Mayor by fellow Council members, making national headlines as the the
            first African American openly lesbian mayor in the country (and the first African American female mayor in
            Massachusetts). She served again as Mayor from 2016 to 2017. In January 2018, she began her ninth term on
            the City Council. The hallmarks of her tenure have been affordable housing, inclusionary zoning, public
            safety, green jobs, wage equity, and continually addressing issues of equality in the City. While Mayor, she
            made government accessibility to citizens a priority, holding weekly walk-in hours, opening the
            Mayor&rsquo;s Parlor for public ceremonies, and hosting Town Hall meetings at City Hall on issues pertaining
            to senior citizens, affordable housing, immigrants' rights in an era of national divisiveness, and to the
            LGBTQ community. Simmons founded a free after school leadership program for 8th grade girls, which now is
            run in partnership with YWCA Cambridge, called the Girls Only Leadership Development program (GOLD). During
            her second term as Mayor, Simmons also successfully pushed for greater historic representation of women in
            City Hall, which throughout more than 130 years had previously only featured portraits of prominent men who
            had contributed to the community. Simmons is deeply invested in the ongoing development of this project.
            <br><br>
             Simmons describes herself as her family historian and archivist and has spent time
            in Georgia and Alabama researching her family roots. Her political activism on behalf of racial equality and
            her historical research led her to successfully push for the creation of a memorial to Prince Hall on the
            Cambridge Common in 2010. Hall was a freed slave, founder of Black Freemasonry, and an orator who fought to
            end the slave trade and slavery, integrate the Revolutionary Army and provide education and rights to
            citizens of African descent. In 2008, Simmons introduced a resolution, R-20, in the City Council to
            recognize Prince Hall as a Founding Father of the United States, which passed. She sees the memorial as a
            monument to all civil rights activists that followed in Hall&rsquo;s footsteps. Simmons is also behind an
            effort to create a Cambridge museum, which would document the city&rsquo;s rich and diverse history. <br><br>
             Simmons is a mother to four children, Jada, Nadene, Atieno, and Anthony (deceased),
            and a grandmother to five. In August 2009, she married her longtime partner Mattie B. Hayes of Brooklyn, New York.
            They became the first same-sex couple to marry at St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s Episcopal Church, one of the
            oldest African American churches in Cambridge, known for its social justice activism. Their marriage was
            officiated by Rev. Leslie Sterling, Reverend Irene Monroe, and Simmons&rsquo; daughter, Jada D. Simmons who,
            like her mother, is a Justice of the Peace. </p>

        narrative: `
            Born Alice Marchant Kimball in Illinois, she attended
            Mount Holyoke College, graduating in 1928. She continued her education, studying
            English social history at Yale, where she met and married the physicist and
            metallurgist Cyril Stanley Smith in 1931. Marriage did not prevent her from
            completing her PhD in 1936. <Br><Br> The couples' two children then accompanied
            Cyril to Los Alamos, New Mexico in the early forties where he worked on the
            creation of the first atomic bomb as part of the famous &#8220;Manhattan Project,&#8221;
            under the direction of J. Robert Oppenheimer. While in New Mexico, Alice Smith
            taught at the Los Alamos High School from 1943 to 1945. Her acquaintance with
            the excitement of the scientific community at Los Alamos led her to edit the
            letters of Oppenheimer many years later. <br><br>
            After the war, the family moved to Chicago while her husband taught at the University
            of Chicago. There she served as assistant editor of the renowned Bulletin of
            the Atomic Scientists, a journal that opposed the future use of atomic weapons.
            In 1961, she and her husband moved to Cambridge where her husband was named
            Professor of Metallurgy at MIT, jointly holding a position in Humanities where
            he taught the history of his subject. <br><br>
            Alice Kimball Smith became one of the first Radcliffe
            Institute (Bunting) Fellows in 1963 and later became director of the Institute
            from 1971 to 1973 (at the time, she was living at 31 Madison Avenue in Cambridge). She also served as director of the Radcliffe Seminars from
            1963-1971. She wrote two books that reflected her experiences at Los Alamos
            as well as her knowledge of the science and the scientists and their varied
            reactions to the creation of the atomic bomb, A Peril and a Hope: the Scientists'
            Movement in America 1945-1947 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1965),
            and (with Charles Weiner), J. Robert Oppenheimer: Letters and Recollections.
            (Harvard University Press, 1980). <br><br>For the last six years of her life, she moved
            to the state of Washington to be near her daughter.

        narrative: `
            Born Joan Forrester in New York City in 1935,
            she received a bachelor's degree in architecture from Cornell in 1953
            and a master's degree in education from Harvard in 1976. At the beginning
            of her career, she worked in furniture design (producing a butcher block couch)
            and consulted with companies, including Sprague Associates, Architectural Resources,
            Inc., and Benjamin Thompson &amp; Associates, Inc. In 1957, she married Chester
            Sprague, a professor of architecture at MIT, with whom she shared an interest
            in exploring the architecture of Native American pueblos. <br><br>

            In Cambridge she co-founded a non-hierarchical
            practice for women architects, Open Design Office. With a group of feminist
            architects (Katrin Adam, Noel Phyllis Birkby, Ellen Perry Berkeley, Bobbie Sue
            Hood, Marie I. Kennedy, and Leslie Kanes Weisman), she organized the Women's
            School of Planning and Architecture (WSAP), which offered summer sessions around
            the country between 1974 and 1981 (at the time she was living at 10 Kirkland Road in Cambridge). She was a successful feminist architect and
            planner, who focused on developing low-income housing for women and children.
            She was involved in the Women's Design Center and Women's Development
            Corporation in Rhode Island, and Women's Housing for Housing and Economic
            Development in Boston. She also worked as a consultant for the Better Homes
            Foundation, Save the Children, and the Women's Housing Coalition in Albuquerque.<br><br>

            Sprague wrote two manuals,<em> A Development Primer:
                Starting Housing or Business Ventures by and/or for Women</em> (1984), and <em>A
                Manual on Transitional Housing</em> (1986). She also wrote two major books,
            <em>Taking Action: A Comprehensive Approach to Housing Women and Children in
                Massachusetts </em>(1988), and <em>More than Housing: Lifeboats for Women and
                Children</em> (1991). She lectured at Columbia, MIT, Arizona State University,
            and in the Netherlands, Canada, the People's Republic of China, and the
            former Soviet Union. She won the Massachusetts Women's Political Caucus's
            Abigail Adams award in 1988. <br><br>She died of brain cancer in Cambridge. Her papers
            are held at Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute.`,
