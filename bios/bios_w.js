            Abernethy Wallace was the daughter of Ethel (Thomas) and Walter Eugene Abernethy.
            She grew up in Shelby, North Carolina. She attended Meredith College in Raleigh,
            where she met her future husband, James (Jim) Wallace with whom she shared a
            life-long commitment to social justice and instilled the same values with their
            children. She accompanied Jim to Cornell University, then to Los Angeles, where
            she worked as a youth advisor at a local church. The family then moved to Buffalo,
            New York, where Julia received a Masters degree in education. After they moved
            to Cambridge, she obtained a second Masters as a reading specialist and then
            taught remedial reading for many years in the Cambridge public schools. <br><br>
            Both Julia and Jim were active in the Old Cambridge
            Baptist Church, In the early 1970s, they became founding members of the cooperative,
            Commonplace, on Oxford Street in Cambridge where she lived for the rest of her
            life. Jim and Julia worked for many peace and social justice causes and hosted
            refugee families from Chile and El Salvador, sometimes for as long as a year,
            during the periods of oppression in Central and South America. They both were
            active in the Sanctuary movement (1985 &#8211; 1990) and Julia accompanied Estela
            Ramirez/Magdalena Rivas while she presented her talks on the movement. Julia
            sat on the Cambridge-San Jos&eacute; las Flores sister city committee (1986
            &#8211; 2009), often traveling to San Salvador to encourage democratic development
            and cultural exchange. <br><br>
            Toward the end of her life, stricken with Alzheimers,
            she continued to work to the best of her ability with different disadvantaged
            communities. She was awarded the Msgr. Romero Peace Award by Centro Presente
            in March 2009. A memorial after her death allowed many of these organizations
            to celebrate her life. One of the organizations she worked with, Adbar Ethiopian
            Women's Alliance, with the cooperation of a number of other immigrant and social
            justice organizations, created a quilt in her honor which was hung on display
            at the Cambridge Public Library in Central Square. A program, sponsored by the
            Cambridge Women's Heritage Project, using this quilt as a departure point, was
            presented in honor of the immigrant Cambridge women who work for social justice,

            Nominated by Chris Womendez
        </p>
        <p>Betsy
            Warrior was a radical activist and organizer of women's liberation and
            the battered women's movements in Cambridge, Boston and the nation. In
            1968 she began organizing and agitating as one of three original members of
            Cell 16, a women's liberation group that exposed the subordination of
            women and advocated for equal pay, childcare, reproductive rights, economic
            justice and self-defense. These early messengers for women's rights campaigned
            against unpaid labor by homemakers, wife abuse, exposed the inequality of women
            in the workforce and in intimate relationships and they trained women in karate
            for self-protection. She was an author and editor of the Journals of Female
            Liberation. </p>
        <p>Often, in the late sixties, Warrior
            could be found disseminating feminist literature written by Cell 16 on the streets
            of Cambridge in Harvard Square. At that time, promoting the ideas of female
            liberation met with hostility or ridicule. As people began reading and arguing
            these ideas some attitudes began to change, and women especially began to drop
            their denial of male supremacy and support feminist perspectives. This street
            agitation served an important role in broadcasting ideas, as not only the corporate
            press, but also alternative presses were male controlled, virulently sexist,
            and women, as usual, lacked the financial resources to compete with the male
            propaganda machines. Distributing literature on the street was one way to foil
            male suppression of this female insurrection.</p>
        <p>In 1969 Warrior's economic
            analysis of women's unpaid labor: Housework: Slavery or a Labor of Love
            and The Source of Leisure Time was published. In Housework, she posited that
            wife beating was an occupational hazard of the housewife who, deprived of monetary
            remuneration for her labor, lacked resources and recourse to escape male-pattern
            violence. In Leisure Time she described how women create leisure time for others
            by performing most of the life sustaining, arduous tasks necessary for everyday
            existence, thus freeing others for more creative endeavors. In 1971 Warrior
            and Lisa Leghorn wrote and edited the Houseworker's Handbook, an economic analysis
            of the unpaid labor of houseworkers, which makes inevitable women's lack
            of economic leverage in the paid labor force - and in every other sphere It
            is this economic disenfranchisement that creates a breeding ground for abuse.
            How much are employers willing to pay workers who characteristically work for
            free? Three editions of the Handbook were published.</p>
        <p>On International Women's Day,
            1971 Betsy marched from Boston to Cambridge in a demonstration to demand a center
            for women. Some of the demonstrators took over a Harvard building until they
            were given space for a Women's Center at another location. At the new
            Women's Center, Betsy built and stocked a library of books on women's
            struggles for self-determination, provided GED classes, and explored options
            for starting a women's press. Simultaneously, she was active in welfare
            rights and tenant's rights organizing. In 1974, while working with Chris
            Womendez and Cheri Jimenez, who established the first shelter dedicated to battered
            women, and with Respond, another shelter group, Warrior realized the need for
            a compendium of resources, analyses of male-pattern violence and templates for
            shelter procedures so she undertook a decade long effort to provide a network
            to knit the shelter movement together by sharing resources and knowledge. </p>
        <p>As a result, Warrior wrote, edited
            and published Working on Wife Abuse (later called Battered Women's Directory),
            which was the first international directory of individuals and programs advocating
            for battered women. It provided statistics on wife abuse, articles on the history,
            motivations and utility of male-pattern violence, explained legal options like
            restraining orders, offered articles by men working to combat sexism by counseling
            abusive men and provided a bibliography on woman abuse as well as advice from
            emergency room doctors treating battered women. It included guidelines for setting
            up shelters, hotlines and support groups for battered women. Nine editions were
            published. The first edition was 33 pages and the last, in 1989, was 300. The
            Schlesinger Library for Women at Harvard houses her &quot;collection&quot; which
            contains some of her correspondence with people setting up shelters and services
            in the early years. http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~sch00439</p>
        <p>Warrior was born in Boston's
            South End in 1940, the child of Canadian immigrants. Married at 17, she endured
            years of abuse (as is the case for millions of women even today) by her husband
            before being able to leave with her child. Thereafter, she adopted the name
            &#8220;Betsy Warrior&#8221; to commemorate a Native American activist. She identifies
            as a working-class woman of multiple ethnicities, including Canadian Micmac,
            and is self-educated. To support her activism Warrior worked in factories, at
            a gas station, as a janitor, and finally, for many years, as a librarian. She
            worked at the Women's Center for nearly 40 years providing advocacy and
            support for battered women and training for other women and agencies to facilitate
            such groups.</p>
        <p>In 1985, Betsy and other
            activists attempted to place an anti-pornography Human Rights Ordinance on the
            ballot in a Cambridge election. When the city refused, the women sued the city
            and won. The referendum was placed on the ballot, but was narrowly defeated.
            If such an amendment had succeeded in being enacted, it could have allowed people
            harmed by pornography to sue its publishers, providing a useful instrument to
            protect women and children who are subjected to pornography as a &#8220;seasoning&#8221;
            tool to inure them to sexual abuse and trafficking, and for men who become unwittingly
            addicted to pornography.</p>
        <p>In 1987 Warrior won an award from
            Boston Woman's magazine for bettering the lives of women in the Greater
            Boston area. In 1991 she received recognition for her work with Finex House
            and the first Jane Doe Unsung Hero Award was given Warrior in 1993. In 2007
            Women's ENews also recognized her work in widely fostering and networking
            shelters for battered women calling it &#8220;The Betsy Warrior Effect.&#8221;
            Starting in 2001 Warrior also worked with Adbar the Ethiopian Woman's
            Alliance for a decade helping design layout for their newsletter &#8220;Mela,&#8221;
            editing and fielding articles as well as designing a logo for the Ethiopian
            Alliance's Sheba enterprise.</p>
        <p>During her years as a human rights
            activist, Warrior also designed some iconic posters for the feminist movement
            including &#8220;Strike While the Iron is Hot: Wages for Housework,&#8221; &#8220;Disarm
            Rapists: Smash Sexism,&#8221; &#8220;For Shelter and Beyond.&#8221; Recently,
            Betsy developed a series of International Women's Rights Posters honoring
            women activists from many continents. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN7qpEEw1Ow
            ). She has also posted some of her watercolors on YouTube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZIGGp6SBtQ.
            Many of Betsy's books and articles are now out of print. In the future,
            she is hoping to post them on the web for ready access by feminists and others
            working to end male violence against women.</p>
        <p>&#8220;Betsy Warrior was
            more than an inspiration to the early battered women's movement. She provided
            critical analysis of &#8220;male-pattern violence,&#8221; offered support to
            struggling feminists establishing women's centers and shelters, and established
            a broad, international network of women and men Activists committed to ending
            men's violence toward women. To say we are profoundly indebted to her
            vision, passion and dedication is an understatement. Her contributions are beyond
            comprehension and certainly far exceed this modest herstory of Betsy Warrior.&#8221;

            Florence Josephine Lee was born on 4 September 1862 in Canton, New York, to
            John Stebbins Lee (born in Vermont in 1820) and Elmina (Bennett) Lee (born in
            New Hampshire in 1821). John S. Lee was Principal of the Preparatory Department
            at St. Lawrence University in Canton, which helped to prepare students for the
            university's Theological School. (Florence's brother, John, later
            became the university's president.) Oddly, a fraternity that now occupies the
            Lee family's Canton house claimed Florence as its resident ghost, believing
            she had died there tragically and her &#8220;mischievous, teasing wraith&#8221;
            haunted the house. In fact, Florence was a graduate of St. Lawrence and later
            a member of its board of trustees. Whitman Hall on the campus is named for her
            and her husband.<br><br>
             On 27 June 1895 in Canton, New York, Florence married Edmund
            Allen Whitman, who was born in 1860 in KS. By 1896, the couple was living at
            23 Everett Street in Cambridge. The house is now occupied by Harvard Law School.
            Edmund Whitman was an 1881 graduate of Harvard College. He practised law in
            Boston. He was a supporter of the environmental movement as well as an outspoken
            proponent of prohibition enforcement. He died in 1952.<br><br>
            The Whitmans' three children were born in Cambridge:
            Allen Lee Whitman in June 1897, Frederic Bennett Whitman in September 1898,
            and Eleanor Whitman in 1902.<br><br>
            Florence Whitman was a clubwoman and frequent
            public speaker at the Cantabrigia Club, League of Women Voters, and area churches.
            She would speak on topics such as woman suffrage, Americanization, and temperance.
            She began her political life as a member of the Cambridge School Committee.
            First elected in 19xx, she served on that board for 8 years. After the passage
            of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920, she attended the first conference for politics
            and government sponsored by Smith College and the Massachusetts League of Women
            Voters in the spring of 1923. That fall she ran for and was elected to a two-year
            term on the Cambridge School Committee. In 1925, Whitman became the first woman
            elected to the Cambridge City Council. She served a single two-year term. She
            died at home in 1948, aged 86 years.

            Anne Whitney was the daughter of gentleman farmer
            Nathaniel Whitney and his wife Sarah (Stone). Her family moved from Watertown
            to East Cambridge in 1833, where her father was a justice of the peace. She
            was educated by private tutors and attended a girls' school in Bucksport, Maine.
            <br><br>Soon after, at the age of twenty-five, she opened a school in Salem which she
            ran for two years. She began to publish her poetry in the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>
            and <em>Harpers' Magazine</em>, collected in a volume entitled simply,
            <em>Poems</em> (New York, 1859), but her interest turned to sculpture. She studied
            with the sculptor, and painter, William Rimmer, in Boston. In that same year
            that her book of poetry appeared, she opened a sculpture studio in the backyard
            of her family home. Subsequently, she made several visits to Rome where she
            studied for four years, producing two of her best works during that time. She
            became acquainted there with the American women sculptors, Harriet Hosmer and
            Edmonia Lewis. <br><br>
            On her return from Europe in 1873, she established
            a studio in Boston. There she executed busts, medallions, and statues, including
            a statue of Samuel Adams (for which she traveled to Paris to study), of which
            two copies, one in bronze and one in marble, are respectively in the capitol
            at Washington and in Boston (1863). Among her works, were statues and portrait
            busts of well-known women, including Harriet Martineau, (presented to Wellesley
            College but destroyed in a fire) Lucy Stone, and Harriet Beecher Stowe. Her
            statue of Charles Sumner, completed when she was eighty, is just outside of Harvard Square.
            Her anonymous entry in the 1875 design competition for the Sumner statue was
            first selected and then disqualified by the judges when they learned it had
            been designed by a woman. With the support of friends, she completed the statue
            in 1902, and it was installed in Cambridge rather than Boston. <br><br>
             She
            was an active member of the woman suffrage movement and was a close friend as
            well as a cousin of the Activist, Lucy Stone. She lived in Boston and summered
            in the White Mountains in Shelburne, New Hampshire until her death in 1915.
            She is buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge. Her papers are held in the
            Wellesley College Archives.

            The Window Shop began as a consignment shop created
            by a group of women (many of them Harvard wives) who wished to help refugees
            fleeing Europe. Although many of the refugees were professionals and scholars,
            they often were unable to obtain positions in their own fields. The Window Shop
            offered a way to earn a living within the community, hiring hundreds of individuals
            over the years. <br><br>It survived for almost half a century, developing into a profitable
            dress and gift shop that included a restaurant and bakery. First located on
            the second floor of 37 Church Street in Cambridge, it soon outgrew that location.
            In November of 1939, it moved to 102 Mt. Auburn Street and opened a tea room
            and bakery, soon offering a lunch as well. Donations from many individuals kept
            the shop going until it could prove its viability. It was incorporated in 1941.
            In the early 1940s, it was one of the few businesses in Cambridge to hire African
            Americans leaving the South. In 1947, the shop moved again to 56 Brattle Street,
            where it remained until 1971 enjoyed by generations of Cantabridgians, becoming
            a favorite haunt of many, including the architect Walter Gropius. Eleanor Roosevelt
            even wrote about the delightful food and atmosphere at the Window Shop in her
            newspaper column &#8220;My Day&#8221;.<br><br>
            Among the women who were significant in organizing
            and running the Window Shop in those early days were Elsa Br&auml;ndstr&ouml;m
            Ulich, a founding board member from Sweden, who was president of the Window
            Shop from 1942 until her death, Elizabeth (Cope) Aub who was a founding board
            member and later president (1954-1964).: Mary Mohrer, who oversaw the dress
            and gift shop, and Alice Perutz Broch, manager of the kitchen and bakery. For
            a brief time, the Window Shop attempted to serve as a club house in off- periods
            for refugees, but this need soon diminished. An assistance fund for the employees
            that also provided scholarships for their children, was created in 1943, named
            after Ulich in 1948.<br><br>
            For many years, the Window Shop was a profitable
            and attractive restaurant and gift shop until the 1960s, when its revenues declined.
            In early1972, the board decided to sell the building to Cambridge Center for
            Adult Education which still is located there. The board then established college
            scholarship funds, a peer-counseling program at Cambridge Rindge and Latin,
            which was named in memory of Mary Mohrer, and donated the corporation's papers
            to the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe. In March 2004, the Cambridge Women's
            Heritage Project celebrated the history of the Window Shop. On March 10, 2007,
            the Window Shop held a meeting in honor of the publication of a book detailing
            its history. <em>The Window Shop: Safe Harbor for Refugees, 1939-1972</em>,
            was written by by Ellen Miller, Ilse Heyman and Dorothy Dahl, and published
            in 2007 by iUniverse. It is available in bookstores.`,

            was
            baptized in Boston at the First Church of Boston on February 12, 1727. She

            after
            Tolman's early death, to John Winthrop in 1756. Hannah and John Winthrop lived
            in Cambridge, where her husband was professor
            of mathematics and natural history
            at Harvard University and a noted astronomer. Their house was located at
            the northwest corner of Mount Auburn and John F. Kennedy streets facing the
            market square, now called Winthrop Square. <br><br>
             Hannah provided a lively account of

            directed to a place called Fresh Pond, about a mile from the town, but what
            a distressed
            house did we find it, filled with women whose husbands had gone forth to meet
            the assailants, seventy or eighty of these, with numbers of infant children,
            weeping and agonizing for the fate of their husbands.&#8221; The following
            year, she wrote to Mercy Warren about the eagerness with which men and women
            sought
            to inoculate themselves and their children against the smallpox.: &quot;The
            reigning subject is the small pox. Men, women and children eagerly crowding
            to inoculate is I think as modish as running away from the troops of a barbarous
            George was last year.&quot; A portrait

            Ozeline Barrett Pearson was the second daughter

            to Worcester, Massachusetts soon after the
            birth of his first daughter, Satya (Pearson) Barrett. Soon after Ozeline's
            birth, the family moved to Cambridge where for many years he was pastor of St.
            Paul African Methodist Episcopal Church.<br><br>
            Ozeline attended Cambridge public schools and graduated from Cambridge High
            School.
            She held clerical jobs until she married John Wise in 1931. The couple adopted
            a son, Hubert Smith, in 1961. Ozeline Wise worked for the Navy during World War
            II, and after the war, she was the first black woman employed by the banking
            department of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, where she worked for nearly
            twenty years.<br><br>
            During the 1950s, the Wises lived in Billerica, Mass., in a house which they
            ran as an inn that they named Galehurst. Some time after her husband's
            death in 1963, she returned to Cambridge to live with her sister, Satya Barrett.
            She spent much of her energy at St. Paul AME Church, serving as a Sunday School
            teacher, trustee, and chair of the building fund. She worked with her older sister
            Satya in many of the same community organizations, and was a charter member of
            the Citizens' Charitable Health Association.<br><br>
            From 1965, Wise lived with her sister, who had suffered a series of strokes,
            caring for her sister until her death in 1977. She contributed an oral interview
            to the <em>Black Women Oral History Project</em> of Schlesinger Library. Ozeline Wise

            Pearl
            Katz, the daughter of Julius Katz, was born in Kovno, Russia, in 1900 or 1901.
            She emigrated with her mother and two older siblings to Connecticut in 1905,
            where her father later joined them. Although she went only through high school,
            she was self-educated to a remarkable degree. In 1921, the family moved to Cambridge,
            and in 1927 she married a young lawyer, Henry Wise. They had three children
            (two daughters and a son) who attended Cambridge schools. Beginning in 1942,
            Wise became involved in public affairs. She served first as president of the
            League of Women Voters of Cambridge (1942-1945).<br><br> In 1945, she organized the
            Parent-Teachers Association at Cambridge High and Latin School and was its first
            president in 1947, working successfully to obtain federally funded hot lunches
            in the schools. In 1948, she organized and led the statewide legislative campaign
            of the Massachusetts League of Women Voters, fighting to allow women to sit
            on juries in the Massachusetts courts. In 1945, she was elected to the Cambridge
            School Committee, on which she served for three terms from 1949 to 1955. For
            one of the three terms, she was the vice chair. <br><br>
            Pearl Wise was responsible for the establishment
            of a library in each Cambridge public school. This action was memorialized by
            the naming of the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School's library in her honor in
            1983. In 1955, she became the first woman, since the Plan E form of city government
            was adopted, to be elected to the Cambridge City Council; she served until 1963.
            During this period she cast the deciding vote to reject the proposed urban renewal
            project in East Cambridge, which would have razed about 150 homes. Her husband,
            Henry Wise, had a long career in labor law and was a major proponent of public
            housing and legislation to restrict urban renewal in Massachusetts. <br><br>After Wise's
            retirement from the City Council, she worked at the Cambridge Housing Authority
            for many years. Her papers are held at Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute.`,

            The Women's Center (aka The Women's Educational Center, The Cambridge Women's Center) arose from the action
            by a feminist protest group, Bread and Roses
            that was seeking a place to situate a women's center for under-served
            women in Cambridge. On March 6, 1971, the women marched and took over a former
            industrial building at 888 Memorial Drive, which was then owned by Harvard.
            While occupying the building, the women offered free child care and classes
            for women. <br><br>After ten days they were forced out, but the protest sparked community
            interest that led to the purchase of a house at 46 Pleasant Street in Cambridge.
            The Women's Center (later incorporated as the Women's Educational Center) opened
            in January 1972 in the house at 46 Pleasant Street. It was committed to the
            philosophy that empowered women could help themselves and effect change in their
            communities. <br><br>
             Staffed mostly by volunteers, the Women's Center
            provides women with referrals to outside community resources, including doctors,
            therapists, lawyers, clinics, housing and job opportunities. Its newest project,
            Women of Action, organizes women to fight for their rights, most recently insisting
            that the MBTA stop to pick up women with children in baby carriages. Some groups
            that began by meeting at the Women's Educational Center, developed into independent
            organizations, including the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center, Finex House, Incest
            Resources, and Transition House, a shelter for women and children. Archives
            from 1971 to 1988 are held at Northeastern University Library.</p>

            The Women's Coffeehouse was organized in October
            1979 when a small group of women from the Women's Center
            in Cambridge, Massachusetts met to discuss plans to open a coffeehouse operated
            by and for women. The stated objective of the Women's Coffeehouse was to provide
            &quot;an active, participative, grass roots environment&quot; (The Women's Coffeehouse,
            Event Schedule, February-April 1989) where local women to develop their own
            community despite their personal political affiliations. <br><br>Weekly performances
            were intended to spark discourse among women in the community about their shared
            issues and concerns. They realized that women of all ages, nationalities, body
            types, economic status, and disabilities lacked a space to safely enjoy cultural
            activities together. <br><br>
            The first Coffeehouse event was held in December
            1979 and featured Marjorie Parsons as the guest speaker. For the next ten years
            the Coffeehouse remained open, sponsoring performances that included local musicians,
            writers, speakers and activists such as Hillary Kay, Nancy Aberle, Beth Hodges,
            Linda Brown, Pamela Gray, Sharon Kennedy, and Betsy Zelchin. These weekly performances
            were intended to spark discussions among women in the community in order to
            share their issues and concerns. Although the core organizers of the Women's
            Coffeehouse were feminists, they were careful to reach out to and welcome all
            women. The archives held by the Northeastern University Library documents the
            organization and activities of the Women's Coffeehouse and contains meeting
            minutes, photos, fliers, and audiotapes of performances and press releases.

            Conceived in 1973, the same year of the landmark Supreme Court decision
            affirming a women&rsquo;s right to an abortion, the Women&rsquo;s Community Health Center was organized by
            Cookie Avrin, Jennifer Burgess, and Terry Plumb, along with many others. In 1974, WCHC acquired a physical
            space at 137 Hampshire Street and incorporated as a non-profit. The goal was to offer a woman controlled and
            owned health center for education, prevention, and health services. For seven years, WCHC gave women tools
            to gain control of their health, health care, and lives. <br><br>Though Roe v. Wade affirmed the legal right to
            abortion, the decision did not create widespread access to abortion. Many of the abortion services were
            developed at women-owned clinics created to provide holistic women&rsquo;s health care. The Women&rsquo;s
            Community Health Center in Cambridge, the Vermont Women&rsquo;s Health Center, and New Hampshire
            Women&rsquo;s Health Services were some of the first clinics created to provide healthcare for and by women
            as alternatives to the traditional medical system. Upon arriving at the WCHC, people completed a
            &ldquo;herstory&rdquo; form to share information about family medical history, current needs, and
            preferences for care. They&rsquo;d meet a health worker who was committed to incorporating health education
            into every step of medical care, primarily through demonstration (&ldquo;self-help&rdquo;). For a breast or
            cervical exam, health workers first demonstrated on themselves. Patients, in front of the health worker,
            could practice what they learned to make sure they got it right. They could opt to have a doctor perform the
            exam.<br><br>
            The organizers believed that health care should not be provided for a profit.
            Rather than a predetermined sliding scale, there was a suggested fee system. Funding came from community
            support, including performances with local poets and singers, a $5000 grant from the Boston Women&rsquo;s
            Health Book Collective (which authored Our Bodies, Ourselves), and the sale of speculums to the general
            public. <br><br>
            WCHC translated all literature into Spanish and Portuguese and offered
            Spanish-speaking and lesbian self-help and groups. From 1975-76, members of the collective instructed
            Harvard Medical School students on the pelvic exam after &ldquo;local women medical students requested the
            program to change the inadequate and oppressive methods usually employed in pelvic instruction.&rdquo;
            (Women&rsquo;s Community Health Center Second Annual Report).<br><br>
            WCHC provided essential services to women, including abortions and gynecological
            care. It operated with a physician&rsquo;s license and employed women doctors. In March of 1975, the center
            began a frustrating process of applying for a clinic license, which wouldn&rsquo;t be granted until January
            of 1981, only months before WCHC had to close its doors. Fenway Community Health Center provided followup
            care to WCHC patient. Becoming the only women owned licensed clinic in the state was a success but came with
            staff burnout and public criticism. The work of WCHC lived on through the community members engaged with the
            center.`,

            The Women&rsquo;s Law Collective started at 678 Massachusetts Avenue and
            relocated to 187 Hampshire Street in 1982. It was one of many law collectives in Cambridge and Boston at the
            time, but the only one led entirely by women. The collective started as a course, &ldquo;Women and the
            Law,&rdquo; with law students as founding members. Their goal was to raise women&rsquo;s awareness about
            laws related to their everyday lives. They provided representation for cases such as divorce, abortion,
            workers&rsquo; rights, and welfare.<br><br>
            While several iterations of the group existed over the years, Holly Ladd led
            the Hampshire Street collective in the early 1980s. The Women&rsquo;s Law Collective&rsquo;s work addressed
            legal issues which impact women and families today. Notably, it co-drafted the Abuse Prevention Act, which
            allows domestic violence survivors access to restraining orders and other supports. Lawyers in the
            collective represented Our Bodies Ourselves, workers&rsquo; unions, and same-gender couples before the
            marriage equality act. <br><br>
            The collective contributed to the revival of the National Lawyers Guild in
            Massachusetts, which now supports local activists and works to eradicate racism and other forms of
            discrimination. The Women&rsquo;s Law Collective eventually dissolved (date not available).<br><br>
             A history of 1970s law collectives from the National Lawyers Guild Massachusetts
            Chapter describes law communes as, &ldquo;These communes practiced law in a new way, involving themselves
            directly in anti-war and community work as participants on the front lines. They rejected all hierarchy
            &ndash; especially distinctions between lawyers and non-lawyers. They functioned as the groups they served:
            egalitarian collectives making decisions by consensus. The lawyers rejected class distinctions, taking turns
            answering the phones while sharing desks and administrative tasks.&rdquo; Students from Harvard and Boston
            University started the first law communes in Central Square, Cambridge, later joined by The Women&rsquo;s
            Law Collective. Radical Boston College law students met informally in a church in Boston&rsquo;s South End
            while another law collective was formed in Dorchester.&quot; `,

            The Women's School was established in 1971 by twenty women who were involved with the <a href="#WomensCenter">Women's
                Center</a> in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The school was founded as an alternative
            source of feminist education, and its ideologies were based on socialist feminism.
            It was operated as a collective with classes taught by volunteer teachers. All
            collective members, students, and teachers were women. Registration fees were
            kept low so that all women would be able to participate. <br><br>In 1973, the collective
            developed a formal administrative structure. Committees were created to select
            courses, develop special projects, and handle office work and finances. Classes
            were offered on anti-racism, auto mechanics, growing up female, international
            women's struggles, lesbianism, Marxism, women's aging, and many
            other topics. The Women's School closed in 1992. It was the longest running
            women's school of its type in the United States. The archive of the school,
