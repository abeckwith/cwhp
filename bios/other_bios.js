        In 1901, Constance M.K. Applebee mounted the first demonstration of the
        English game of field hockey in the United States. It was held in
        Cambridge, Massachusetts, in a courtyard adjacent to the Harvard
        University gymnasium. A graduate of the British College of Physical
        Education in London, she had come in this country to take a course in
        anthropometry, the measurement of the human body. The demonstration
        took place while she was attending a women's physical education course at
        Harvard.<Br><Br>
        Through her energy and enthusiasm, field hockey soon became very
        popular in women's colleges such as Vassar, Smith, Wellesley, Mount
        Holyoke, and Radcliffe.<Br><Br>
        "The Apple," as she was known, was hired in 1904 as athletic director at
        Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, a position she held through 1928. In
        1901, she founded the American Field Hockey Association and headed it
        for 20 years. She also helped found the United States Field Hockey
        Association in 1922 and the following year created a field hockey camp in
        Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania. She was for 10 years the editor and
        publisher of Sportswoman, a magazine for women athletes, the first
        magazine of its kind in America.<Br><Br>
        Throughout her life, Applebee commuted between England and the United
        States, coaching young woman in field hockey and the importance of
        sportsmanship. She did not retire until she was 94.

            During her college years, Megan Gaffney was a psychology
            major at Harvard (Class of 2002) who pursued an interest in women's issues.
            For a Women's Studies class titled, &#8220;Women, Violence, and the Law,&#8221;
            Gaffney conducted a study of violent music lyrics that advocated harm to women,
            analyzing the verses of rap and heavy metal. At the end of the semester, her
            professor, Diane Rosenfeld, suggested an independent study to prepare the work
            for publication. <Br><Br>
            She assisted Rosenfeld in researching the prosecution of a
            case in which domestic violence led to the death of a pregnant woman. As co-director
            of Peer Relations and Date Rape Education, sponsored by Harvard's University
            Health Services, she dealt with recruiting and advertising for this student-run
            group. Megan helped to foster a dialogue between the university and her fellow
            students on the issues of sexuality, which opened the group to some criticism
            for promoting too open a forum on this topic. <Br><Br>
            
            Megan interned in the business
            department of <em>Harvard Magazine</em> as a work-study student. She also starred
            in many Harvard theater productions while at college, most notably as the Acid
            Queen in a student production of The Who's <em>Tommy</em>. She sang in
            the <em>a capella</em> singing group &#8220;The Callbacks&#8221;, often counseling
            apprehensive performers at auditions. <br><Br>After leaving Harvard, she took a job
            as spokesperson for the US attorney's office in Manhattan, appearing regularly
            in New York press reports.<br>
            <br>As of 2025, Megan was working for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Ohio `,

            Hannah Adams was the first American-born professional
            author, the daughter of Elizabeth (Cook) and Thomas Adams. Born in the town
            of Medfield, she began to publish to supplement her family's income, writing
            on religious and historical themes. Her first book was a list of religious groups
            entitled <em>Alphabetical Compendium of the Various Sects Which Have Appeared
                From the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Present </em>(1784), This went
            through a number of editions in Boston and London. She followed this with historical
            works, <em>A Summary History of New-England </em>(1799), and <em>A History of
                the Jews</em> (1812).<br><br> She began to attract friends among literary and religious
            men in Boston who provided an annuity for her. She produced a final study, <em>Letters
                on the Gospels</em> in 1826. Although eccentric in her old age, she had a decided
            influence on her contemporaries and was among the first persons to be buried
            at Mount Auburn Cemetery. An autobiographical memoir of her life appeared the
            year after her death, written partly to provide financial support for her younger
            sister.<Br><Br>
            In her 1799 work "A Summary History of New-England: from the first settlement at Plymouth, to the acceptance of the federal Constitution",
            Adams wrote about the "Rise of the controversy between Great Britain and New England":
            <blockquote>
            "In the forgoeing history, we have seen the designs of Dudley, Randolph, Andros, 
            and others, to establish an arbitrary government in New England. Ever jealous of 
            encroachments upon their privileges, the American settlers baffled all their schemes.
             Their insidious designs were buried with them for a long period..."

            Charlotte Cushman is the only female actress to
            be enshrined in the University of Hall of Fame for Great Americans. She was
            the daughter of a failed businessman, Elkanah Cushman and his second wife, Mary
            Eliza Babbitt. Raised in Boston where her mother ran a boarding house, she trained
            to become an opera singer but an ill- fated attempt to extend the range of her
            husky contralto voice while touring in New Orleans. <br><br>Advised to turn to the theater,
            she was offered the part of Lady Macbeth by the manager of the main theater
            in that city, making a successful debut at the age of twenty. She soon moved
            to Philadelphia and New York where she appeared regularly, developing an enthusiastic
            following, especially as Nancy in &#8220;Oliver Twist,&#8221; and as Lady Macbeth.
            She took on other Shakespearean roles, including a large number of male roles,
            for example playing Romeo opposite her sister Susan's Juliet and notably
            

            as Hamlet. <br><br>In 1844, she went to London where she made a sensational hit, even
            appearing before Queen Victoria. After a number of highly successful tours of
            America, she temporarily retired from the stage at the age of thirty=seven and
            with her accumulated wealth spent her winters in London and her summers in Rome
            where she lived with the sculptor Emma Stebbins, opening her house as a center
            for English and American writers and artists including the Brownings and Harriet
            Hosmer. She moved back to Boston in 1870 with Emma Stebbins and established
            homes in Boston and Newport, occasionally returning to the stage for special
            performances. <br><br>She suffered from cancer and finally retired permanently from
            the stage in 1874. Two years later she died of pneumonia and was buried in Mt
            Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge. `,

            Sophia Hayden was born in Chile and was raised by her grandparents in Jamaica Plain in Boston.
            She was the first woman to graduate
            in architecture from MIT in Cambridge in 1890. After graduation, she taught
            mechanical drawing at a high school in Jamaica Plain. <Br><Br> Hayden won the competition
            to design the Woman's Building at the World's Columbian Exposition
            in Chicago in 1893 commemorating the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's
            discovery of America. <br><br>In an effort to draw attention to women's progress
            in entering previously all-male professions, the Board of Lady Managers had
            established a $1,000 prize for a woman architect. Hayden's design was
            for an Italian Renaissance exhibit hall with skylights. This was awarded the
            Gold Medal from the Board of Lady Managers, though the design was criticized
            for its &quot;daintiness and grace&quot;. Hayden, although barely out of school,
            and only 22 years old was asked to go to Chicago supervise the construction
            of her design. Unfortunately, overwhelmed by the pressure of supervising such
            a large construction project, and negative critical response to her work, Hayden
            experienced a collapse at the site, but returned a few months later for the
            dedication of the building.
            
            <br><br>She retired from architecture and never designed

            Ellen Swallow was born in the small town of Dunstable,
            Massachusetts to Fanny and Peter Swallow. She attended Westford Academy in Westford, Massachusetts,
            graduating in 1863. After studying and then teaching in Worcester, she went
            to Vassar College, which had just opened at an advanced level, graduating in
            1870. She then had the opportunity to attend the Massachusetts Institute of
            Technology as a special student, the first woman to be accepted at any scientific
            school. In 1873, she received a second bachelor's degree from MIT and
            a master's degree from Vassar. She continued to study at MIT and to work
            under John Nichols on practical problems, such as water safety for the state.
            In 1873 she married Robert Hallowell Richards, a professor of mining engineering
            at MIT. <br><Br>
            With the help of the Women's Education Association
            of Boston, Ellen Richards established a Woman's Laboratory at MIT in 1876
            under the directorship of John M. Ordway, which offered training to women in
            a wide range of sciences; Richards was named an instructor at the laboratory.
            When women were admitted as MIT undergraduates to regular laboratories in 1883,
            the women's laboratory closed. Richards was then appointed an instructor
            in sanitary chemistry and continued to work in the field of sanitation and home
            economics (a field she helped establish) until her death. She also created a
            Center for Right Living in her home in Jamaica Plain, testing foods and promoting
            sanitation. <Br><Br>She published two widely cited books, <em>The Chemistry of Cooking
