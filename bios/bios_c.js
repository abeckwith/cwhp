            In 1878, Pauline Agassiz Shaw (Mrs. Quincy Shaw),
            influenced by Elizabeth Peabody's
            kindergarten movement, realized that working mothers needed a safe space for
            their children during working hours. She rented and then bought a building at
            the corner of Harvard and Moore streets in which she established a day nursery
            and
            a kindergarten.
            In 1879 she opened a library and reading room and held sewing classes,
            and
            in
            1883 she began a club for mothers, a playground, and dressmaking
            and woodworking classes for children. The kindergarten that was established was
            taken
            over in
            1889 by the Cambridge Public Schools.<br><br> By 1900, Shaw had established classes in
            music, drawing, and painting. In 1914, a Health Committee was organized. Eventually,
            the
            neighborhood house expanded to offer industrial training and economics classes.
            As a result of lectures on hygiene and health, the Mothers' Club was organized
            in
            1896. The club was renamed
            in
            1902
            as
            the
            Neighborhood
            Women's
            Club. <br>
            The Cambridge Neighborhood House began to involve
            a
            broader
            group of women,
            catering
            to
            working
            class women of any ethnic background or religion. It served as an educational,
            social, and recreational center for nearly a hundred years. The house, which
            had been listed on the National Register of Historic Places to commemorate
            Shaw's work, burned in 1973 and had to be torn down. <br><br>The activities of
            the organization were
            relocated to the Margaret Fuller House at 71 Cherry Street.

            This political education committee was founded
            
            in 1896 &quot;to extend study and discussion with a view to securing political
            equality for American citizens.&quot; Although the main focus was suffrage for
            women, CPEA also studied and supported African-American suffrage and proportional
            representation. Its leading officer and president was Grace
                A. (Fitch) Johnson, who served as its president until 1916.<br><br>
            Although it began by sponsoring meetings and lectures,
            after 1900 CPEA helped organize suffrage rallies and parades, and raised money
            for woman suffrage through bazaars and rummage sales. By 1901, the organization
            was affiliated with the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association. It also worked
            with the Cambridge Woman Suffrage Party and other organizations like the Cambridge
            Public School Association (in which Johnson was also an officer). It encouraged
            women to register and to vote in school committee elections. <br><br>CPEA later became
            part of MWSA and appears to have been the forerunner of the Cambridge League

             The Cambridge School was the first to offer women
            graduate training in both architecture and landscape architecture under a single
            faculty. It began as a &quot;little experiment&quot; in the office of Henry
            Frost, professor of architectural design at Harvard University, with only nine
            to twelve students, all women. One of its earliest graduates was Eleanor A.
            Raymond (1887-1989), who went on to make a name for herself as a distinguished
            architect specializing in domestic buildings. <br><br>The school could not be incorporated
            under Harvard proper since that remained an all-male institution. In 1924 it
            was incorporated under Massachusetts law as a separate educational institution.
            After several short term locations, the school settled into a building at 53
            Church Street, the Torrey Hancock House of 1827. A large addition was built
            by the school in 1928 in the International Style.<br><br>
            In 1934, Smith College became affiliated with
            the school. The School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture retained its
            own name and independent organization, but had the privilege of recommending
            its students to Smith for the graduate degrees of Master in Architecture and
            Master in Landscape Architecture.<br><br>
            Two years later, the graduate degrees of Bachelor of Architecture and Bachelor
            of Landscape Architecture were introduced, preceding the Master's degrees, which
            were later added as well. By 1938, the School became an actual part of Smith
            College's Graduate School in architecture and landscape architecture but
            remained in Cambridge. When William Allan Neilson, president of Smith College,
            resigned in 1939, support for the school at Smith began to dwindle. The school
            was closed in 1942, and women were the same year allowed to enroll at the Harvard
            Graduate School of Design. Harvard's school of design had seen a large percentage
            of its male student population join the armed forces after the country's entry
            into World War II and was seeking new ways to keep tuition coming in. The Cambridge
            School Corporation formally dissolved in 1945. The archives of the school are
            held at Smith College and include student transcripts and faculty reports as
            well as other documents and exhibitions.`,

            Born
            in Delaware to Mary Elizabeth (Jump) and Wilson Lee Cannon, a Delaware politician,
            Annie was educated in the public schools and at the Wilmington Conference Academy.
            She became interested in astronomy at a young age with her mother's encouragement.
            She then went to Wellesley College where her professor, Sarah Whiting encouraged
            her interests in astronomy and physics. She turned to music after graduation
            in 1884, but was shocked out of a more traditional life by the death of her
            mother in 1893. She returned to Wellesley for postgraduate study and as an assistant
            to Professor Whiting and then enrolled as a special student at Radcliffe (1895-1897).
            <br> <br>
            Cannon was hired by Professor Edward Pickering
            at the Harvard College Observatory as a staff assistant beginning in 1896, joining
            Williaminia Fleming in studying stellar spectra on photographic plates. She
            was awarded a Master's degree from Wellesley in 1907, and after the death
            of Fleming, she succeeded her as curator of astronomical photographs (1911-38)
            at the Harvard College Observatory.  <br> <br>Classifying
       
       stellar bodies according
            to their temperatures, she published the <em>Henry Draper Catalogue</em> in
            nine volumes (1918-1924), which listed the faintest to the brightest spectra
            of stars from the North to South Poles and the <em>Henry Draper Extension</em>
            in two volumes (1925-1949) that included even fainter stars. The two catalogs
            represented a total of about 350,000 stars. She also discovered 300 long-period
            variable stars. She was made an honorary member of the Royal Astronomical Society
            in England (1914) and one of the few women elected as an honorary member of
            the American Philosophical Society (1925). She was honored with honorary degrees
            from Oxford and the University of Groningen. In 1938, she was made William Cranch
            Bond Astronomer at Harvard, one of the first appointments to a named chair made
            by Harvard.  <br> <br>She entertained children as well as colleagues at her home at 4
            Bond Street in Cambridge next to the Observatory, and sponsored egg-rolling
            contests at Easter for children on the hill. She was an advocate of women's
            suffrage and a member of the National Women's Party and a popular lecturer
            on her subject.

            of women's clubs, Merrill organized the club to present regular lectures
            on topics that ranged from current events to art and science. Soon after the
            organization joined the General Federation of Women's Clubs, and in 1893,
            joined the State Federation. By 1896, the Cantabrigia Club became involved in

            The founding group of the Female Liberation group
            was called &quot;Cell 16&quot;, located at 552 Mass Ave. Historically, it began
            with a group of women gathering at Emmanuel College for a women's conference
            

            in 1969. The women broke up into smaller groups, one of which met afterwards

            to emphasize that they were only one cell of an organic movement and in reference

            its original meeting address, 16 Lexington /Ave. The group began to publish
            a magazine, <em>No More Fun and Games; A Journal of Female Liberation</em>.
            The Female Liberation group grew out of Cell 16. Its most important contribution
            was its publication of the magazine <em>The Second Wave Magazine: A Magazine
                for the New Feminism</em> in 1971 that continued until 1983 even after its parent
            organization was dissolved. It included news stories, poetry, fiction, graphics,
            and articles that expressed a wide range of feminist viewpoints. <br> <br> In February
            1974, Female Liberation disbanded as a result of conflicts between members who
            belonged to the Socialist Workers Party and the majority who did not. `,

            developed into an active community organization with a wider mission to develop
            adult education programs (ESL, literacy, and citizenship), youth leadership
            development (Pintamos Nuestro Mundo), and immigration legal services. <br><br>It was
            founded by Sister Rose Marie Cummins (then attached to Saint
            Mary's Catholic
            Church), members of the Salvadoran immigrant community, and members of the legal
            community in Cambridge. The current address is 54 Essex St., 2nd Floor in Cambridge
            but the youth program is based in East Somerville. <br><br>The organization recently
            honored its founder and the past directors, Frank Sharry and Oscar Chacon at
            the twenty-fifth anniversary party.

            Jeanne
            Chall was an expert on reading instruction who taught a generation of teachers
            at the Graduate School of Education, Harvard University. Born in Poland, Chall
            immigrated to New York City with her family at the age of seven. She went to
            the New York public schools and graduated with honors from the City College
            

            of New York at the age of twenty. <br><br>Her first position was as an assistant to
            Irving Lorge, who directed educational research at Teachers College, Columbia
            University. She went on to do graduate work with Edgar Dale at Ohio State University,
            where she received an A.M. degree in 1947 and her Ph.D. in 1952. She became
            interested in the issue of readability which led her to write <em>Readability:
                An Appraisal of Research and Application</em> (1958). She returned to City College
            as lecturer, rising to professor by 1965. She collaborated throughout her life
            with Florence Roswell, director of the reading clinic at the college, on the
            diagnosis and treatment of reading difficulties.<br><br>
            In 1965, she moved to Harvard University as full
            professor to create and direct graduate programs in reading instruction. She
            founded the Harvard Reading Laboratory in 1967 (now named after her) and directed
            it until her retirement in 1991. She was a member of numerous scholarly organizations,
            editorial boards, and state and national commissions. Among her many professional
            awards was that given by the International Dyslexia Association in 1996.<br><br>
            She served as a consultant for encyclopedias for
            children and children's television programs including &quot;Sesame Street,&quot;
            &quot;The Electric Company,&quot; and &quot;Between the Lions.&quot; She was
            interested in the issues surrounding reading and poverty and produced a book
            on this topic,<em>The Reading Crisis: Why Poor Children Fall Behind</em> (1990).
            Her final book, <em>The Academic Achievement Challenge: What Really Works in
                Classrooms</em>, was published after her death in 2000.`,

            that ranged from celebrities to ordinary restaurant-goers. She began to teach
            Chinese cooking at both the Cambridge and Boston Adult Education Centers and,
            in 1962, she published a widely-praised cookbook,<em> Joyce Chen Cook Book</em>.

            Julia Child was born in Pasadena California. She
            graduated from Smith College in 1934. After taking a variety of positions in
            advertising and journalism, she served with the Office of Strategic Services
            during World War II. <br><br>After the war, she married Paul Cushing Child who was a
            diplomat with the Foreign Service .The couple lived for some years in Paris
            while Paul was assigned to the exhibit wing of the U.S. Information Agency.
            

            During that period, Julia took classes at the famous Cordon Blue cooking school.
            In 1951, she opened a cooking school, L'Ecole des Trois Gourmandes, (The
            School of Three Gourmands) with two partners. In 1961, the three women published
            <em>Mastering the Art of French Cookery</em>, considered at the time to be the
            best book on the subject in English. <br><br>
            In 1961, Julia and her husband moved to Cambridge
            where she remained until a few years before her death. In 1963, she began a
            regular series of television programs, &#8220;The French Chef&#8221; on Boston's
            WGBH, part of the Public Broadcasting Service, that catapulted her into national
            celebrity. She won a Peabody Award in 1965 and an Emmy in 1966 for the series,
            which continued for ten years In 1968, she published <em>The French Chef Cookbook</em>,
            including much of the content from her programs. In the 1970s and 1980s, she
            starred in further programs, &#8220;Julia and Company&#8221; and &#8220;Dinner
            at Julia's.&#8221; A series of cook books also came out of this and her

   In 1971, Quaker
                Case, Mav Pardee, Maggie Sears, and Heidi Urich founded the Child Care Resource Center (CCRC) because
                they recognized that access to quality, affordable child care was essential to women&rsquo;s pursuit of
                equality in the workplace and beyond.<br><br>
        
           CCRC was one of
                the first child care resource and referral centers in the country. The need for this service was so
                great that over 400 similar organizations were established nationwide in the following years. CCRC
                worked to increase the supply of parent and worker controlled, non-sexist, and nonracist child care; to
                improve quality by offering staff training, recruitment and consultations; and to help parents find and
                select child care by offering comprehensive information and counseling.<br><br>
         
          Their services
                expanded across Greater Boston with support from the Ford Foundation and public and private grants and
                contacts. It was a leader in advocating for more public and private resources for child care, including
                state funded vouchers for low income families and employer-sponsored child care and services for
                employees. Its Multicultural Project promoted non-discriminatory practices in early childhood settings
                and became independent with a Rockefeller Foundation grant.<br>Cambridge Chronicle, 18 November 1971

            Clayground was co-owned and created by Annie Hoffman and Carole Ann Fer as a

            hours, and connected with other women&rsquo;s organizations in the neighborhood by creating commemorative
            platters and pottery, like anniversary pottery for New Words Bookstore. It also offered workshops and
            apprenticeships to women and became involved in the wider Cambridge community by creating banners for the
            AIDS quilt and Mel King, a well known Boston politician and community organizer. <br><br>
            Annie and Carole met at Mudflat (a woman-owned pottery studio now located in

            Bertha Cohen was a Polish immigrant who came to
            Boston at the age of twenty-two. She worked as a milliner in the old Chandler
            department store in Boston, living so frugally that she would eventually be
            able to purchase an apartment building, now 999 Memorial Drive in Cambridge,
            where she also resided. <br><br>The income from this property enabled her to continue
            to invest in real estate, wisely choosing to purchase commercial properties
            in Harvard Square. She still maintained her frugal life-style, appearing throughout
            her life, according to the president of Cambridge Trust, as though she &#8220;did
            not have a dime.&#8221; She had a small office in the basement of her apartment
            house which various observers described as very small and poorly lit. Nevertheless,
            she continued to manage all her properties herself with the aid of one secretary.
            <br><br>
            She was said to have delighted in being a &#8220;thorn in the side of Harvard
            University,&#8221; refusing to sell properties to its corporation. One of the
            former Harvard deans claimed that when the then president, Pusey, sent him to
            inquire about her willingness to will a small piece of land on Mount Auburn
            Street to Harvard in order to establish a Bertha E. Cohen Park after her death,
            she scolded him, saying she had no desire to have a park named after her. <br><br>
            Although she appeared at first glance to be a
            &#8220;scary old lady,&#8221; she was kind to young people, agreeing to rent
            one of her properties to the young founders of the 47 Mount Auburn jazz coffee
            house in 1957 that would soon make Harvard Square a haven for renowned folk
            singers. (Now Club Passim at 47 Palmer Street).<br><br>
            By the time of her death at age sixty-seven in
            1965, she owned twenty-seven properties in Cambridge and about fifteen more
            in the Boston area and was referred to as the &#8220;owner of Harvard Square.&#8221;
            Her estate was estimated at about twelve million dollars at her death and included
            a number of companies including Curtis Realty, Inc., Cober Realty Inc., Hemenway

        narrative: `
            Born in Moorhead, Minnesota to Solomon G. Comstock,
            a successful lawyer and politician, Ada Comstock was the eldest of three children.
            She completed her high school education at the young age of fifteen and then
            went on to college at the University of Minnesota. After two years, she transferred
            to Smith College. <br><br>After graduating from Smith in 1897, Ada attended the Moorhead
            State Normal School for a teaching certificate and then entered Columbia University
            for graduate work in English, History, and Education. She returned to the University
            of Minnesota in 1899 to teach rhetoric and in 1907, she was appointed the University's
            first Dean of Women, actively improving the situation of young women at the
            

            college. In 1912, Comstock went to Smith College as professor of English and
            as the first Dean of the College. Comstock believed in the power of a college
            education in inspiring women to take on leadership roles. <br><br>
            In 1917, during World War I, the presidency of Smith College became vacant and
            Ada Comstock directed the operation of the college for six months without the
            title of acting President. She was a founding member of the Association of Collegiate
            Alumnae, later called the American Association of University Women, which she
            served as president. She was one of five American voting delegates to the first
            conference of the International Federation of University Women in London in
            1920 and at the second in Paris in 1922. Amongst her other activities, she served
            as president of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Vice Chairman of
            the American Council of Institute of Pacific Relations and sat on the National
            Committee for Planned Parenthood.<br><br>
            In 1923, Radcliffe College offered her the position
            of the first full-time President of the college. Throughout most of her administration,
            Ada Comstock worked to keep a balance between Radcliffe's association with Harvard
            and its establishment as an independent women's college, since Radcliffe had
            no faculty of its own. Under her guidance, the college opened a nationwide admission
            program, built new student housing and classroom buildings and expanded its
            graduate program. <br><br>
            In 1943, Comstock retired from her position at
            the age of sixty-seven, and shortly after, she married Wallace Notestein, a
            retired professor of history at Yale University whom she had known as a young
            instructor at the University of Minnesota. She continued to be active in planning
            and working as a trustee at Smith College, and as organizer of the graduate
            center at Radcliffe which is named after her. She also traveled extensively
            with her husband. Ada Comstock died in New Haven in December of 1973. Her personal
            papers are in the Smith College archive and other papers dealing with Radcliffe
            are held in the Radcliffe College archives in Schlesinger Library

        narrative: `
            Lucy Ainsworth, also known as &#8220;Sleeping
            Lucy&#8221; was born in Vermont to Lucy (Burnham) and Luther Ainsworth. As a
            young girl she was apprenticed to a tailor by her parents. When she fell ill,
            and became bedridden, her younger brother, Luther Ainsworth, who studied mesmerism,
            put her into an hypnotic trance and presumably cured her with herbal remedies
            that she described in her trance. When she recovered, she decided with her brother's
            help to become a healer. Because she would only perform healing of patients
            while in a trance, she was referred to by her patients as &#8220;Sleeping Lucy.&#8221;
            For some years, her brother worked with her, developing her reputation as a
            healer. In 1846, she married Charles Cooke also a mesmerist, and the couple
            established their enterprise in Reading Vermont until 1855 when Charles died.
            <br><br>
            

            Following the death of her husband, Lucy Cooke
            moved to Montpelier, where she continued her healing business with the help
            of an assistant, Everett William Raddin, who later became her second husband.
            They developed a successful mail-order business, offering consultations by mail,
            and selling various herbal remedies. Dr. Lucy Cooke also claimed to be able
            to set bones and heal fractures by laying on of hands. <br><br>
            Her reputation and her business grew until 1876
            when the couple moved to the Boston area. Perhaps the growing importance of
            women physicians recognized by their male colleagues and the existence of a
            successful woman-run hospital, (the New England Hospital for Women and Children)
            made the practice of a woman healer less remarkable, and less profitable. The
            couple, through mismanagement by Raddin or lack of clients, fell into debt while
            Lucy became estranged from her only daughter. In the late 1880s and reputedly
            abused by her husband, Lucy moved to North Cambridge. <br><br>She became seriously ill
            and eventually died of what appears to have been colon cancer in 1895. An oil
            painting of Lucy Ainsworth as a young married woman is in the collections of
            the Vermont Historical Society.<br>

            Jane Curtin was born in Cambridge and attended
            a Catholic school there. She then went to New York City where she studied at
            Elizabeth Seton Junior College in New York City, obtaining an associate degree.
            She returned to Boston to study drama at Northeastern University, but left in
            1968 when she landed a $40 a week acting job with &#8220;The Proposition,&#8221;
            a topical, politically-oriented comedy show in Cambridge that included a number
            of other talented comedians. She married Patrick Lynch in 1975 and has one daughter.<br>
            <br><br>In the fall of 1975, she had an opportunity to
            become a charter member of the Not Ready For Prime Time Players on NBC's &#8220;Saturday
            Night Live.&#8221; Curtin remained on the show for five seasons, creating a
            number of memorable characters, including Prymaat Conehead. She became widely
            known as the co-anchor of &#8220;Weekend Update.&#8221; When Dan Ackroyd and
            John Belushi moved to Hollywood to make movies, Curtin made one movie &quot;How
            

            to Beat the High Cost of Living&quot; (1980) with a future television sitcom
            partner, Susan Saint James, but for some years, Curtin preferred the stage.
            She performed in the Broadway production of George Bernard Shaw's &#8220;Candida&#8221;
            with Joanne Woodward in 1981, which was adapted for television two years later.<br><br>
            She returned to television to appear in the sitcom
            &#8220;Kate and Allie&#8221; opposite Susan Saint James in a story about divorced
            mothers in Greenwich Village. This lasted for five years and won her Emmy awards
            for her role in 1984 and 1985. She appeared in an American Playhouse presentation
            of Alfred Hitchcock's &#8220;Suspicion&#8221; but returned to the stage
            to play in &#8220;Love Letters&#8221; and Michael Frayne's popular farce,
            &#8220;Noises Off.&#8221;<br><br>
            In 1990 she appeared in a miniseries about desegregation in Boston called &#8220;Common
            Ground.&#8221; From the 1996 until 2001, she performed an important role in
            the television sci-fi comedy series &#8220;Third Rock from the Sun,&#8221; with
            John Lithgow, for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe award and won a
            Golden Satellite award. In the summer of 2001, she appeared with Paul Newman
            in Thornton Wilder's &#8220;Our Town&#8221; in the Westport County Playhouse
            which signaled Newman's return to the stage and was made into a miniseries
            on television. She has continued to appear in a variety of television roles
            to the present.<br><br>
            Curtin also worked for UNICEF for several decades,
            appointed as an official UNICEF ambassador in 1990 on behalf of international
            children's health and childcare initiatives. In 1991, she received the

            Charlotte Cushman is the only female actress to
            be enshrined in the University of Hall of Fame for Great Americans. She was
            the daughter of a failed businessman, Elkanah Cushman and his second wife, Mary
            Eliza Babbitt. Raised in Boston where her mother ran a boarding house, she trained
            to become an opera singer but an ill- fated attempt to extend the range of her
            husky contralto voice while touring in New Orleans. <br><br>Advised to turn to the theater,
            she was offered the part of Lady Macbeth by the manager of the main theater
            in that city, making a successful debut at the age of twenty. She soon moved
            to Philadelphia and New York where she appeared regularly, developing an enthusiastic
            following, especially as Nancy in &#8220;Oliver Twist,&#8221; and as Lady Macbeth.
            She took on other Shakespearean roles, including a large number of male roles,
            for example playing Romeo opposite her sister Susan's Juliet and notably
            

            as Hamlet. <br><br>In 1844, she went to London where she made a sensational hit, even
            appearing before Queen Victoria. After a number of highly successful tours of
            America, she temporarily retired from the stage at the age of thirty=seven and
            with her accumulated wealth spent her winters in London and her summers in Rome
            where she lived with the sculptor Emma Stebbins, opening her house as a center
            for English and American writers and artists including the Brownings and Harriet
            Hosmer. She moved back to Boston in 1870 with Emma Stebbins and established
            homes in Boston and Newport, occasionally returning to the stage for special
            performances. <br><br>She suffered from cancer and finally retired permanently from
            the stage in 1874. Two years later she died of pneumonia and was buried in Mt
            Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge. `,
