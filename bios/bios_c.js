            In 1878, Pauline Agassiz Shaw,
            influenced by Elizabeth Peabody's
            kindergarten movement, realized that working mothers needed a safe space for
            their children during working hours. She rented and then bought a building at
            the corner of Harvard and Moore streets in which she established a day nursery
            and
            a kindergarten.
            In 1879 she opened a library and reading room and held sewing classes,
            and
            in
            1883 she began a club for mothers, a playground, and dressmaking
            and woodworking classes for children. The kindergarten that was established was
            taken
            over in
            1889 by the Cambridge Public Schools.<br><br> By 1900, Shaw had established classes in
            music, drawing, and painting. In 1914, a Health Committee was organized. Eventually,
            the
            neighborhood house expanded to offer industrial training and economics classes.
            As a result of lectures on hygiene and health, the Mothers' Club was organized
            in 1896. The club was renamed in 1902 as the
            Neighborhood
            Women's Club. <br><Br>
            The Cambridge Neighborhood House began to involve a
            broader group of women,  catering to   working
            class women of any ethnic background or religion. It served as an educational,
            social, and recreational center for nearly a hundred years. The house at 79 Moore Street, which
            had been listed on the National Register of Historic Places to commemorate
            Shaw's work, burned in 1973 and had to be torn down. <br><br>The activities of
            the organization were
            relocated to the Margaret Fuller House at 71 Cherry Street.

            This political education committee was founded
            
            in 1896 &quot;to extend study and discussion with a view to securing political
            equality for American citizens.&quot; Although the main focus was suffrage for
            women, CPEA also studied and supported African American suffrage and proportional
            representation. Its leading officer and president was Grace
                A. (Fitch) Johnson, who served as its president until 1916.<br><br>
            Although it began by sponsoring meetings and lectures,
            after 1900 CPEA helped organize suffrage rallies and parades, and raised money
            for woman suffrage through bazaars and rummage sales. By 1901, the organization
            was affiliated with the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association. It also worked
            with the Cambridge Woman Suffrage Party and other organizations like the Cambridge
            Public School Association (in which Johnson was also an officer). It encouraged
            women to register and to vote in school committee elections. <br><br>
            
         


            In January, 1909, eleven years before women earned the right to vote in the U.S., the Cambridge 
            Chronicle reported on a meeting at which Mary Page of Brookline spoke to the Association: 
            <blockquote>
            "The Cambridge Political Equality Association held a meeting on Saturday afternoon, at the 
            residence of Mrs. John Brooks, 5 Ash Street...Mrs. Page's subject for the afternoon was 
            'The Miltant Suffrage Movement in England.' She spoke simply, but with much force, explaining 
            the conditions in England that caused the Suffragette movement. [The English woman] has not 
            the social equality with man which has so helped American women...
            <Br><Br>
            "As the ladies listened to Mrs. Page, they heard the war cry of the little mill girl, 
            the Jeanne d'Arc, of England, echoing in their ears; they felt the force of the spirit of
             the times which has roused all England 'Women, this is War.'"
            </blockquote>

            During World War I, the CPEA also did work for the war effort. In a May 1917 CPEA meeting, the subject was...
            <blockquote>
            "...the increase and conservation of the food supply, this being the special patriotic 
            task to which the suffragists of the vicinity are devoting themselves[...]the work of 
            arranging for the permission to cultivate vacant lots [and] about 400 persons had thus 
            far received permits to plan land aggregating over 35 acres."
            </blockquote>

            
            CPEA later became
            part of MWSA and appears to have been the forerunner of the Cambridge League
            of Women Voters, formed after women's votes were secured nationally.`,

             The Cambridge School was the first to offer women
            graduate training in both architecture and landscape architecture under a single
            faculty. It began as a &quot;little experiment&quot; in the office of Henry
            Frost, professor of architectural design at Harvard University, with only nine
            to twelve students, all women. One of its earliest graduates was Eleanor A.
            Raymond (1887-1989), who went on to make a name for herself as a distinguished
            architect specializing in domestic buildings. <br><br>The school could not be incorporated
            under Harvard proper since that remained an all-male institution. In 1924 it
            was incorporated under Massachusetts law as a separate educational institution.
            After several short term locations, the school settled into a building at 53
            Church Street, the Torrey Hancock House of 1827. A large addition was built
            by the school in 1928 in the International Style.<br><br>
            In 1934, Smith College became affiliated with
            the school. The School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture retained its
            own name and independent organization, but had the privilege of recommending
            its students to Smith for the graduate degrees of Master in Architecture and
            Master in Landscape Architecture.<br><br>
            Two years later, the graduate degrees of Bachelor of Architecture and Bachelor
            of Landscape Architecture were introduced, preceding the Master's degrees, which
            were later added as well. By 1938, the School became an actual part of Smith
            College's Graduate School in architecture and landscape architecture but
            remained in Cambridge. When William Allan Neilson, president of Smith College,
            resigned in 1939, support for the school at Smith began to dwindle. The school
            was closed in 1942, and women were the same year allowed to enroll at the Harvard
            Graduate School of Design. Harvard's school of design had seen a large percentage
            of its male student population join the armed forces after the country's entry
            into World War II and was seeking new ways to keep tuition coming in. The Cambridge
            School Corporation formally dissolved in 1945. The archives of the school are
            held at Smith College and include student transcripts and faculty reports as
            well as other documents and exhibitions.`,

            Born
            in Delaware to Mary Elizabeth (Jump) and Wilson Lee Cannon, a Delaware politician,
            Annie was educated in the public schools and at the Wilmington Conference Academy.
            She became interested in astronomy at a young age with her mother's encouragement.
            She then went to Wellesley College where her professor, Sarah Whiting encouraged
            her interests in astronomy and physics. She turned to music after graduation
            in 1884, but was shocked out of a more traditional life by the death of her
            mother in 1893. She returned to Wellesley for postgraduate study and as an assistant
            to Professor Whiting and then enrolled as a special student at Radcliffe (1895-1897).
            <br> <br>
            Cannon was hired by Professor Edward Pickering
            at the Harvard College Observatory as a staff assistant beginning in 1896, joining
            Williaminia Fleming in studying stellar spectra on photographic plates. She
            was awarded a Master's degree from Wellesley in 1907, and after the death
            of Fleming, she succeeded her as curator of astronomical photographs (1911-38)
            at the Harvard College Observatory.  <br> <br>Classifying
       
       stellar bodies according
            to their temperatures, she published the <em>Henry Draper Catalogue</em> in
            nine volumes (1918-1924), which listed the faintest to the brightest spectra
            of stars from the North to South Poles and the <em>Henry Draper Extension</em>
            in two volumes (1925-1949) that included even fainter stars. The two catalogs
            represented a total of about 350,000 stars. She also discovered 300 long-period
            variable stars. She was made an honorary member of the Royal Astronomical Society
            in England (1914) and one of the few women elected as an honorary member of
            the American Philosophical Society (1925). She was honored with honorary degrees
            from Oxford and the University of Groningen. In 1938, she was made William Cranch
            Bond Astronomer at Harvard, one of the first appointments to a named chair made
            by Harvard.  <br> <br>She entertained children as well as colleagues at her home at 4
            Bond Street in Cambridge next to the Observatory, and sponsored egg-rolling
            contests at Easter for children on the hill. She was an advocate of women's
            suffrage and a member of the National Women's Party and a popular lecturer
            on her subject.

            Brought up in Minnesota, Cornelia James married
            her long-term friend, the physiologist Walter B. Cannon in 1901 after his appointment
            to a position at Harvard. Adventurous, although not accomplished mountaineers,
            the couple climbed to the summit of a peak at the head of Lake McDonald on their
            honeymoon in what is now Glacier National Park (this was later named Mount 
            Cannon). 
            <br> <br> With her husband, Cornelia settled in Cambridge where she raised four
            daughters and one son. In spite of her family responsibilities, running an academic
            household and raising five children, she became an important writer, contributing
            articles on social and economic subjects to <i>Harper's</i>, <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, and
            <I>North American Review</i>. In 1928 she published a novel, <i>Red Rust</i>, that became
            a best-seller. In it, she described the Swedish immigrant farmers of rural
            Minnesota from the area in which she had been raised.  
            <br> <br>In order to have privacy
            for her writing, she had the habit of hiding in the bathroom or in her car,
            as vividly described by her daughter Marion Cannon Schlesinger
            in the memoir, <em>Snatched from Oblivion</em>.
            Cannon wrote about women's rights, birth control, and public 
            education and published a total of eight novels. She was also involved with Planned 
             Parenthood and the League of Women Voters.<Br><br>
             
             Cannon was a frequent and prolific writer of "Letters to the Editor" to the Cambridge Chornicle (writing from her home at 23 Willard Street in Cambridge),
             thoughout the 1920s and 1930s, often writing in support of funds for the public schools and in support of teachers,
             as well as railing against corruption in city government. Her letters were lengthy and regularly took up the full height of the page.
             She certainly had strong opinions, like this one, excerpted from a 1938 letter to the editor:
             
             <blockquote>
            "The mentality of our Cambridge school committee is certainly strange. 
            Last Wednesday they closed our schools for a half day, deprived 14,000 children of their 
            opportunity for education, threw away the thousands of dollars our schools cost every school day, 
            and for what? To give the children the opportunity to take part in the funeral of a Civil War veteran, 
            to accompany the body from the home to the church and from there to the city limits while the funeral 
            cortege made its way on to a cemetery in Waltham. Did they expect the kindergarten children and those 
            of the lower grades to take part? Did they expect the older thousands to walk from distant parts of the city, 
            miles for such a march? Did they remember that closing the schools for half a day deprived half of the 
            high school pupils of an entire day's school attendance? 
            <br><Br>
            "The panoply of death is something from which 
            parents of feeling try to protect their young children. The funeral ceremonial is neither the time nor 
            place to inspire patriotic fervor in children, which I assume was the purpose of the misguided act of 
            the school committee, and instead inspires shrinking or morbid fancies, neither of which is conducive 
            to enthusiasm for one's country. Why could not the children have remained in school and have had exercises
             appropriate to the occasion and to their age in the class or assembly rooms?"
             </blockquote>
            
            In 2011, Maria Diedrich wrote a book about Cannon, trying to understand and disentangle
            Cannon's strong and heartfelt advocacy for women's rights and other causes with her (and her husband's) belief in eugenics,
             generally considered today to have been a set of racist and xenophobic theories.

            who published a column under the name &#8220;Jean Kincaid.&#8221; After discussing
            the evils of sweatshops, the women decided to form a club with the aim of &#8220;encouraging
            mental and moral development.&#8221; <br> <br> The first meeting was held on October 28,
            1892 at 20 Quincy Street in Cambridge and the club's headquarters were
            later constructed at 100 Mount Auburn Street. According to Jane Croly, the historian
            of women's clubs, Merrill organized the club to present regular lectures
            on topics that ranged from current events to art and science. Soon after the
            organization joined the General Federation of Women's Clubs, and in 1893,
            joined the State Federation. By 1896, the Cantabrigia Club became involved in
            education, instituting a Radcliffe Scholarship Fund to benefit a Cambridge student.
             <br> <br>The club extended to philanthropy and for a time maintained a settlement house
            in the city and contributed a &#8220;Cantabrigia free bed&#8221; to the Cambridge
            Hospital.`,

            The founding group of the Female Liberation group
            was called &quot;Cell 16&quot;, located at 552 Mass Avenue. Historically, it began
            with a group of women gathering at Emmanuel College for a women's conference
            

            in 1969. The women broke up into smaller groups, one of which met afterwards
            informally for a year.  <br> <br>In May 1969, the group took the name &#8216;Cell 16&#8221;
            to emphasize that they were only one cell of an organic movement and in reference

            its original meeting address, 16 Lexington Avenue. The group began to publish
            a magazine, <em>No More Fun and Games; A Journal of Female Liberation</em>.
            The Female Liberation group grew out of Cell 16. Its most important contribution
            was its publication of the magazine <em>The Second Wave Magazine: A Magazine
                for the New Feminism</em> in 1971 that continued until 1983 even after its parent
            organization was dissolved. It included news stories, poetry, fiction, graphics,
            and articles that expressed a wide range of feminist viewpoints. <br> <br> In February
            1974, Female Liberation disbanded as a result of conflicts between members who
            belonged to the Socialist Workers Party and the majority who did not. `,

            where she received an A.M. degree in 1947 and her Ph.D. in 1952. She became
            interested in the issue of readability which led her to write <em>Readability:
                An Appraisal of Research and Application</em> (1958). She returned to City College
            as lecturer, rising to professor by 1965. She collaborated throughout her life

            living in Cambridge on Kirkland Street. <br><br>
            
            Nine years later, in 1958, Joyce opened
            the first Mandarin Chinese restaurant in New England at 617 Concord Ave,
            Cambridge. She had not been a professional cook, but had come to realize how much people 
            liked her cooking when her bake sale
            items (pumpkin cookies and egg rolls) immediately sold out at the Buckingham Brown and Nichols school bake sale 
            in the mid-1950s.

            Julia Child was born in Pasadena California. She
            graduated from Smith College in 1934. After taking a variety of positions in
            advertising and journalism, she served with the Office of Strategic Services
            during World War II. <br><br>After the war, she married Paul Cushing Child who was a
            diplomat with the Foreign Service .The couple lived for some years in Paris
            while Paul was assigned to the exhibit wing of the U.S. Information Agency.
            

            During that period, Julia took classes at the famous Cordon Blue cooking school.
            In 1951, she opened a cooking school, L'Ecole des Trois Gourmandes, (The
            School of Three Gourmands) with two partners. In 1961, the three women published
            <em>Mastering the Art of French Cookery</em>, considered at the time to be the
            best book on the subject in English. <br><br>

            In 1961, Julia and her husband moved to Cambridge
            where she remained until a few years before her death. In 1963, she began a
            regular series of television programs, &#8220;The French Chef&#8221; on Boston's
            WGBH, part of the Public Broadcasting Service, that catapulted her into national
            celebrity. She won a Peabody Award in 1965 and an Emmy in 1966 for the series,
            which continued for ten years In 1968, she published <em>The French Chef Cookbook</em>,
            including much of the content from her programs. In the 1970s and 1980s, she
            starred in further programs, &#8220;Julia and Company&#8221; and &#8220;Dinner
            at Julia's.&#8221; A series of cookbooks also came out of this, along with her
            popular public television series. <br><br>

            In 1976, the Boston YWCA honored five Cambridge women who contributed to "improving and expanding 
            opportunities for all women," including Julia Child, because of her 
            <blockquote>
            "...pilot program on French cooking for the deaf and hard of hearing [and for] elevating the 
            traditional art of cooking into an unprecedented national pastime with style, humor, and grace."
            </blockquote>


            
            In the 1990s, she hosted four more series with
            arious celebrity chefs. 
            While her earliest programs were filmed on a television set, 
             "Cooking with Master Chefs," "In Julia's Kitchen with Master Chefs," "Baking with Julia" and
              "Julia and Jacques Cooking at Home" were all filmed in Julia's  
              Cambridge kitchen at 103 Irving Street, just north of the Cambridge 
              Rindge and Latin School. A replica of that Cambridge kitchen is now in Smithsonian's National Museum of American History.

            Much of the interesting cookware she used in that kitchen 
            was provided by Design Research, located in Harvard Square. She often shopped at 
            Savenor's Market, just a few blocks from her home. In the 1990s, she recommended (in an interview)
            Cambridge's Charles Hotel Restaurant, the Inn at Harvard, and Chez Henri.<br><Br>
            Julia Child founded the educational American Institute of
            Wine and Food in Napa, California in 1978. Among her many honors, she was awarded
            the Legion of Honor by the French government in 2001, the U.S. Presidential
            Medal of Freedom in 2003 and honorary degrees from Harvard and Smith. She moved
            to a Santa Barbara California retirement home in 2001, gifting her Cambridge
            home to Smith College and her kitchen to the Smithsonian. <br><br>

            For an 2001 NPR interview, as she was preparing to move to California, in which she said she never expected to grow attached to her adopted city, she said:
            <blockquote> 
            "Cambridge, which is such a nice place, I thought it was going to be very stuffy and as they say, cold, 
            Boston, but I didn't realize that it's such a  nice warm place to be in. And then what's nice about 
            Cambridge is  most people are <i>doing something</i>, so that you meet interesting people...leaving Cambridge 
            is a bittersweet experience."
            </blockquote>

            Child (1920-1993) are in the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe. `,

                Case, Mav Pardee, Maggie Sears, and Heidi Urich founded the Child Care Resource Center (CCRC) because
                they recognized that access to quality, affordable child care was essential to women&rsquo;s pursuit of
                equality in the workplace and beyond.<br><br>
        
           CCRC was one of
                the first child care resource and referral centers in the country. The need for this service was so
                great that over 400 similar organizations were established nationwide in the following years. CCRC
                worked to increase the supply of parent and worker controlled, non-sexist, and nonracist child care; to
                improve quality by offering staff training, recruitment and consultations; and to help parents find and
                select child care by offering comprehensive information and counseling.<br><br>
         
          Their services
                expanded across Greater Boston with support from the Ford Foundation and public and private grants and
                contacts. It was a leader in advocating for more public and private resources for child care, including
                state funded vouchers for low income families and employer-sponsored child care and services for
                employees. Its Multicultural Project promoted non-discriminatory practices in early childhood settings
                and became independent with a Rockefeller Foundation grant.<br>

            City Girl Cafe was a favorite gathering place for local feminists and gay rights activists. <Br><Br>
            Located at 204 Hampshire Street in Inman Square in 1997, the
            restaurant offered lunch, dinner, and catering. Merry Moscato
            and Cheryl Schwartz started it as a catering service in 1993. Moscato had been 
            nicknamed &ldquo;city girl&rdquo; by her brothers and was a graduate of the Cambridge School of Culinary
            Arts in North Cambridge.
            <br><br>The social and activist 
            nature of the cafe was inspired by The Saints Collective, which Moscato and Schwartz had previously been members of.
            The Saints Collective was a group started in 1972 and assocated with The Saints Bar in Boston,
            where women would gather to socialize and to organize demonstrations. They also helped educate the local LGBTQ community about
            their legal rights after government attempts to infiltrate lesbian organizations and 
           the FBI's arrest of Brandeis student and lesbian activit Susan Saxe.
            
            <br><br>
             In 2008, the cafe was purchased by Khavala Macken-Fraizer (also the head
            chef) with her friend, Lauren Anderson. Khavala and Lauren maintained the restaurant&rsquo;s original name
            and much of the menu.

            Clayground was co-owned and created by Annie Hoffman and Carole Ann Fer as a
            &ldquo;socialistic&rdquo; pottery business on Hampshire Street. <Br><Br>The collective offered pottery at lower prices, had flexible
            hours, and connected with other women&rsquo;s organizations in the neighborhood by creating commemorative
            platters and pottery, like anniversary pottery for New Words Bookstore. It also offered workshops and
            apprenticeships to women and became involved in the wider Cambridge community by creating banners for the
            AIDS quilt and Mel King, a well known Boston politician and community organizer. <br><br>

            Annie and Carole met at Mudflat (a woman-owned pottery studio now located in
            Somerville) in 1970 and began selling pottery on the streets until they had the idea to open a storefront.
            In 1976, they rented 97 Hampshire Street until they purchased their permanent home at 91 Hampshire Street in
            1991. Women did all of the renovations, including electrical and plumbing. Now a yoga instructor, Annie
            Hoffman, reflects on the experience as deeply formative. 
            <blockquote>"We were making vessels. The body is a
            vessel, and a house is an outer vessel, so learning how to renovate a space was essential and empowering for
            us as women."</blockquote>

            As of 2019, the space was still owned by Annie Hoffman and was a yoga and expressive
            arts studio named Art &amp; Soul.<br>

        narrative: `
            Bertha Cohen was a Polish immigrant who came to
            Boston at the age of twenty-two. She worked as a milliner in the old Chandler
            department store in Boston, living so frugally that she would eventually be
            able to purchase an apartment building, 992 Memorial Drive in Cambridge,
            where she also resided. <br><br>The income from this property enabled her to continue
            to invest in real estate, wisely choosing to purchase commercial properties
            in Harvard Square. She still maintained her frugal life-style, appearing throughout
            her life, according to the president of Cambridge Trust, as though she &#8220;did
            not have a dime.&#8221; She had a small office in the basement of her apartment
            house which various observers described as very small and poorly lit. Nevertheless,
            she continued to manage all her properties herself with the aid of one secretary.
            <br><br>
            She was said to have delighted in being a &#8220;thorn in the side of Harvard
            University,&#8221; refusing to sell properties to its corporation. One of the
            former Harvard deans claimed that when the then president, Pusey, sent him to
            inquire about her willingness to will a small piece of land on Mount Auburn
            Street to Harvard in order to establish a Bertha E. Cohen Park after her death,
            she scolded him, saying she had no desire to have a park named after her. <br><br>
            Although she appeared at first glance to be a
            &#8220;scary old lady,&#8221; she was kind to young people, agreeing to rent
            one of her properties to the young founders of the 47 Mount Auburn jazz coffee
            house in 1957 that would soon make Harvard Square a haven for renowned folk
            singers. (Now Club Passim at 47 Palmer Street).<br><br>
            By the time of her death at age sixty-seven in
            1965, she owned twenty-seven properties in Cambridge and about fifteen more
            in the Boston area and was referred to as the &#8220;owner of Harvard Square.&#8221;
            Her estate was estimated at about twelve million dollars at her death and included
            a number of companies including Curtis Realty, Inc., Cober Realty Inc., Hemenway
            Investment Co., Melrose Realty Co. Inc., and the Strathcona Realty Trust.`,

            Born in Moorhead, Minnesota" to Solomon G. Comstock,
            a successful lawyer and politician, Ada Comstock was the eldest of three children.
            She completed her high school education at the young age of fifteen and then
            went on to college at the University of Minnesota. After two years, she transferred
            to Smith College. <br><br>After graduating from Smith in 1897, Ada attended the Moorhead
            State Normal School for a teaching certificate and then entered Columbia University
            for graduate work in English, History, and Education. She returned to the University
            of Minnesota in 1899 to teach rhetoric and in 1907, she was appointed the University's
            first Dean of Women, actively improving the situation of young women at the
            

            college. In 1912, Comstock went to Smith College as professor of English and
            as the first Dean of the College. Comstock believed in the power of a college
            education in inspiring women to take on leadership roles. <br><br>
            In 1917, during World War I, the presidency of Smith College became vacant and
            Ada Comstock directed the operation of the college for six months without the
            title of acting President. She was a founding member of the Association of Collegiate
            Alumnae, later called the American Association of University Women, which she
            served as president. She was one of five American voting delegates to the first
            conference of the International Federation of University Women in London in
            1920 and at the second in Paris in 1922. Amongst her other activities, she served
            as president of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Vice Chairman of
            the American Council of Institute of Pacific Relations and sat on the National
            Committee for Planned Parenthood.<br><br>
            In 1923, Radcliffe College offered her the position
            of the first full-time President of the college. Throughout most of her administration,
            Ada Comstock worked to keep a balance between Radcliffe's association with Harvard
            and its establishment as an independent women's college, since Radcliffe had
            no faculty of its own. Under her guidance, the college opened a nationwide admission
            program, built new student housing and classroom buildings and expanded its
            graduate program. She lived at 76 Brattle Street at the time.<br><br>
            In 1943, Comstock retired from her position at
            the age of sixty-seven, and shortly after, she married Wallace Notestein, a
            retired professor of history at Yale University whom she had known as a young
            instructor at the University of Minnesota. She continued to be active in planning
            and working as a trustee at Smith College, and as organizer of the graduate
            center at Radcliffe which is named after her. She also traveled extensively
            with her husband. Ada Comstock died in New Haven in December of 1973. Her personal
            papers are in the Smith College archive and other papers dealing with Radcliffe
            are held in the Radcliffe College archives in Schlesinger Library

        narrative: `
            Lucy Ainsworth, also known as &#8220;Sleeping
            Lucy&#8221; was born in Vermont to Lucy (Burnham) and Luther Ainsworth. As a
            young girl she was apprenticed to a tailor by her parents. When she fell ill,
            and became bedridden, her younger brother, Luther Ainsworth, who studied mesmerism,
            put her into an hypnotic trance and presumably cured her with herbal remedies
            that she described in her trance. When she recovered, she decided with her brother's
            help to become a healer. Because she would only perform healing of patients
            while in a trance, she was referred to by her patients as &#8220;Sleeping Lucy.&#8221;
            For some years, her brother worked with her, developing her reputation as a
            healer. In 1846, she married Charles Cooke also a mesmerist, and the couple
            established their enterprise in Reading Vermont until 1855 when Charles died.
            <br><br>
            

            Following the death of her husband, Lucy Cooke
            moved to Montpelier, where she continued her healing business with the help
            of an assistant, Everett William Raddin, who later became her second husband.
            They developed a successful mail-order business, offering consultations by mail,
            and selling various herbal remedies. Dr. Lucy Cooke also claimed to be able
            to set bones and heal fractures by laying on of hands. <br><br>

            Her reputation and her business grew until 1876
            when the couple moved to the Boston area. Perhaps the growing importance of
            women physicians recognized by their male colleagues and the existence of a
            successful woman-run hospital, (the New England Hospital for Women and Children)
            made the practice of a woman healer less remarkable, and less profitable. The
            couple, through mismanagement by Raddin or lack of clients, fell into debt while
            Lucy became estranged from her only daughter. In the late 1880s and reputedly
            abused by her husband, Lucy moved to North Cambridge, living at 9 Forrest Street, where
            she continued to practice her healing. <br><br>She became seriously ill
            and eventually died of what appears to have been colon cancer in 1895. An oil
            painting of Lucy Ainsworth as a young married woman is in the collections of
            the Vermont Historical Society.<br><Br>

            Rev. Frank Hyatt Smith officiated her funeral. He spoke of <blockquote>

            "[H]er long and successful practice of fifty-three years, in different cities, with 
            patients in all of the states; of her charity and skill; of her honesty and justice; 
            of her felicitous marriage, congenial and true...of the great numbers who had come 
            to her, other agents being powerless, and had gone away cured; and that her life 
            mission had been to help and heal."</blockquote>
        <i>
            (It should be noted that Rev. Smith was arrested in October of that same year, 
            indicted and arrested on charges of "Sending Obscene and Scurrilous Matter Through
             the U.S. Mails." He had sent anonymous, angry, and vulgar notes to the wives of 
             several of the members of his church he had disagreements with. In November, 
             Smith submitted a plea of insanity and was committed to an asylum in lieu of a prison sentence.)</i>

        narrative: `
            <br>Originally from Louisville, Kentucky, Sister Rose Marie Cummings
            joined the Dominican Order soon after graduation. Sister Rose visited Puerto
            Rico from 1966 to 1971 and fell in love with the island. <br><br>She worked in Massachusetts
            from 1972 to 1999. In the mid 1970s, she worked in Framingham, Massachusetts as a bilingual
            counselor in the public school system. She was very active in the Sanctuary
            movement in the 1980s and was one of the co-founders of Centro
                Presente in 1981 during the period that she was attached to Saint Mary's
            Catholic Church at 134 Norfolk Street in Cambridge. She worked for six years as co-director of Centro
            Presente and for three years at Saint Francis House doing immigration work with
            homeless and low-income people from around the world. Sister Rose eventually
            moved back to her home state of Kentucky where she became the director of the Dominican
            Earth Center in Springfield (founded in 1997), a ministry of the Dominicans
            of St. Catharine, Kentucky that encourages a philosophy and lifestyle of sustainable
            living that benefits our environment and those who inhabit it. 
            <br><Br>
            Sister Rose commented on the origins of the name Centro Present in 2006: <blockquote>
            "I had heard the story about when people were gathered together for prayer, 
            and they would say the name of a person who had been very instrumental and showing 
            a lot of courage and leading people forward, and when they said the person's name 
            then everybody would answer 'Presente' which meant that the spirit of that person was
             there, present, with them and giving them courage to keep on and so it felt like a very apt name."</blockquote>
            She was presented
            an Earth Day award in 2006 by the Environmental Quality Commissioner of Kentucky
            and was celebrated in Cambridge at the twenty-fifth anniversary of Centro Presente
            in December 2006.

        narrative: `
            Jane Curtin was born in Cambridge and attended
            a Catholic school there. She then went to New York City where she studied at
            Elizabeth Seton Junior College in New York City, obtaining an associate degree.
            Her parents, Mary Constance (Farrell) and John Joseph Curtin maintained an insurance company in Cambridge at 689 Concord Ave for many years.
            
            Jane Curtin returned to Boston to study drama at Northeastern University, but left in
            1968 when she landed a $40 a week acting job with &#8220;The Proposition,&#8221;
            a topical, politically-oriented comedy show in Cambridge that included a number
            of other talented comedians. <Br><Br>
            
            In a 2019 interivew, Curtin recalled an event in her life in Inman Square in Cambridge:
            <blockquote>
            "My senior year of high school, I went and did summer stock and met a woman, Amy, who said, 
            'I'm auditioning for an improv group. Will you come with me?' I had no idea what improv was. 
            And I said, 'Sure!' So we went, and it was this little converted bakery in Inman Square, in 
            Cambridge, and that was the theatre for the Proposition. It had maybe a hundred seats, and 
            it was right next door to the flagship Legal Sea Foods, so they would give us chowder, 
            because we were all broke. Amy auditioned, and, at the end, there was nobody else there, 
            and they said, 'Does anybody else want to audition?' I thought, I'm going to give it a
             shot. And I got the job."</blockquote>
            She married Patrick Lynch in 1975 and has one daughter. In the fall of 1975, she had an opportunity to
            become a charter member of the Not Ready For Prime Time Players on NBC's &#8220;Saturday
            Night Live.&#8221; Curtin remained on the show for five seasons, creating a
            number of memorable characters, including Prymaat Conehead. She became widely
            known as the co-anchor of &#8220;Weekend Update.&#8221; When Dan Ackroyd and
            John Belushi moved to Hollywood to make movies, Curtin made one movie &quot;How
            

            to Beat the High Cost of Living&quot; (1980) with a future television sitcom
            partner, Susan Saint James, but for some years, Curtin preferred the stage.
            She performed in the Broadway production of George Bernard Shaw's &#8220;Candida&#8221;
            with Joanne Woodward in 1981, which was adapted for television two years later.<br><br>
            She returned to television to appear in the sitcom
            &#8220;Kate and Allie&#8221; opposite Susan Saint James in a story about divorced
            mothers in Greenwich Village. This lasted for five years and won her Emmy awards
            for her role in 1984 and 1985. She appeared in an American Playhouse presentation
            of Alfred Hitchcock's &#8220;Suspicion&#8221; but returned to the stage
            to play in &#8220;Love Letters&#8221; and Michael Frayne's popular farce,
            &#8220;Noises Off.&#8221;<br><br>
            In 1990 she appeared in a miniseries about desegregation in Boston called &#8220;Common
            Ground.&#8221; From the 1996 until 2001, she performed an important role in
            the television sci-fi comedy series &#8220;Third Rock from the Sun,&#8221; with
            John Lithgow, for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe award and won a
            Golden Satellite award. In the summer of 2001, she appeared with Paul Newman
            in Thornton Wilder's &#8220;Our Town&#8221; in the Westport County Playhouse
            which signaled Newman's return to the stage and was made into a miniseries
            on television. She has continued to appear in a variety of television roles
            to the present.<br><br>
            Curtin also worked for UNICEF for several decades,
            appointed as an official UNICEF ambassador in 1990 on behalf of international
            children's health and childcare initiatives. In 1991, she received the
            Danny Kaye Humanitarian Award for this work. <br>
