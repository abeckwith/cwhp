            Julia Valenzuela was a Chilean teacher who came
            to this country in her fifties and made her home in the Central Square area. She made a significant contribution to Latinos
            in Cambridge and in the surrounding cities. As a retired teacher, she was concerned
            with education and was the first Latina to coordinate training in Spanish for
            day care providers through the Cambridge Children Resource Center (CCRC ). Valenzuela
            also was president of the board of &#8220;Fun Ages&#8221; Day Care Providers.
            She founded and organized the first Latino conference on day care. 
            <br><br>
            She was an active and committed member of the
            Substance Abuse Task Force and the Cambridge Affairs Latino Commission well into her 90s. She organized
            Latinos in the campaign for voting rights and provided support to the Latino
            elderly at the Cambridge Senior Center. Governor Michael Dukakis honored her
            for her devotion and extensive work on behalf of Latino children. <Br><Br>
            In 1985, at age 86, she did volunteer work for the Cambridge Red Cross for the Holiday Doll Program and said 
            "You can see the special love and care put into every outfit.  It's wonderful to know that people still take some time
             to make the holidays special for someone else."
            On her death,
            a resolution was passed in her honor by the Cambridge City Council.

            Born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Flavia
            Steiner Viggiani received her degree in early childhood and elementary education
            from Colegio de Educacion Superior. She then studied theater and drama at the
            Escuela Nacional de Arte Dramatico. <br><br>Flavia first became politically active when
            she joined the Argentine&#8220;Peace and Justice&#8221; organization led by
            Adolfo Perez Esquivel, the winner of the 1980 Nobel Peace Prize. During the
            last de-facto government in Argentina, she participated in demonstrations organized
            by the Human Rights Movement know as &#8220;Madres de Plaza de Mayo,&#8221;
            demonstrating for the &#8220;disappeared&#8221; young people who were thrown
            into prison or killed by death squads for political activity. She also was involved
            with the organization &#8220;Arts in Education,&#8221; participating in various
            seminars that included the teaching of the renowned educators Paulo Freire and
            Augusto Boal.<br><br>
            Flavia Viggiani teaches in the combined 5-6 grade
            of the Amigos program at the Kennedy School in Cambridge in a two-way full immersion
            Spanish/English classroom. She shares her class of twenty students with an English-speaking
            teaching partner. Involved in theater and music herself, she arranged an African
            dance production for sixth graders. When her teacher friends in Argentina told
            her about an impoverished, isolated school in the Andes mountains of northern
            Argentina operating without government support, she involved students throughout
            the Kennedy school in &#8220;Operacion Larcas,&#8221; collecting funds, school
            supplies, and winter clothing for the school. <br><br>
             She has also made her name as an actress and singer.
            In December 2000, she sang at the Millenium stage of the Kennedy Center for
            the Performing Arts in Washington as part of the Latin-American group &#8220;Sonabo,&#8221;
            performing innovative arrangements of traditional Latin American songs. An actress,
            she has performed with TheatreZone in Federico Lorca's play, &#8220;The
            House of Bernardo Alba&#8221; during the second &#8220;Lorca in the Park&#8221;
            festival in 2004, and in Jeff Goode's play &#8220;Anger Box&#8221; in Chelsea
            in 2003.`,
