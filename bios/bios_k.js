        narrative: `Pheb Mitchell was born in Massachusetts
            in about 1828. She and her sister Maria were largely educated by their father,
            William Mitchell, a teacher, banker, and amateur astronomer. Phebe married Joshua
            Kendall, a private boys' school teacher, and moved to to Bristol, RI by 1860.
            They later settled in Cambridge, MA. By 1873, Joshua Kendall had opened his
            own private school for boys at 13 Appian Way in Cambridge. The family lived
            at 123 Inman Street, a modest two-story wood frame house. Mr. Kendall operated
            Kendall's Day and Family School from 1873 until 1906. From 1898 to 1906, the
            family also lived at 13 Appian Way. In 1878 Phebe accompanied her sister, the
            astronomer Maria Mitchell, and four Vassar College graduates across country
            by train to Denver Colorado to observe a total solar eclipse through the telescopes
            they had brought with them.<br><br>
            In 1879, the Massachusetts Legislature passed
            a law allowing women to vote in school committee elections. That same year,
            Phebe Mitchell Kendall and Sarah Sprague Jacob
            became the first women elected to the Cambridge School Committee. Phebe Kendall
            served until 1894. In 1896, Phebe Mitchell Kendall edited a biography of her
            sister, Maria Mitchell (1818-1889) who had made her name as astronomer, educator,
            and advocate for the education of women. (<em>Maria Mitchell: Life, Letters
                and Journals</em> (Boston 1896). <br><br>
            Phebe Kendall died in 1907. Her son, William Mitchell
            Kendall, had a distinguished career as an architect and was active in many art
            and cultural organizations. He graduated from Harvard in 1876 and studied architecture
            at MIT. From 1882 until his death in 1941 he worked for the renowned New York
            architectural firm of McKim, Mead &amp; White.<br>

        narrative: `
            The daughter of the renowned physicist George
            B Kistiakowsky and his Swedish wife Hildegard Moebius, Vera was interested in
            science from childhood. She attended school in Massachusetts and Pittsburgh
            and then went to Mount Holyoke College as an undergraduate where she majored
            in chemistry and took pre-med courses. <br><br>Instead of going into medicine, she went
            to graduate school in chemistry at University of California, Berkeley, obtaining
            her PhD in 1952 examining promethium isotopes. She switched to experimental
            nuclear physics, doing her postdoctoral fellowship with Luis Alvarez. While
            in graduate school, she met and married a young physicist, Gerhard Fischer with
            whom she had two children. The couple later divorced.<br><br>
            Kistiakowsky went to Columbia from 1954 to 1959
            where she worked as a research associate under the Nobel prize winner, Madame
            Chien-Shiung Wu. In 1959, she came back to Massachusetts to work at Brandeis
            University in a high-energy laboratory affiliated with MIT. In 1963, she moved
            to MIT's Laboratory for Nuclear Science. Although she had stellar credentials,
            she was appointed professor only in the early 1970s. She worked in experimental
            particle physics, and then in observational astrophysics. She published over
            one hundred articles in these fields.<br><br>
            She became interested in the position of women scientists in the late 1960s
            when she and two other women started a Boston area group called WISE (Women
            in Science and Engineering). In 1970 she organized a committee within the American
            Physical Society (APS) to study the status of women physicists. She has published
            articles and lectured on topics related to women in science. She was president
            of the Association for Women in Science in 1982 and 1983. Among other honors,
            she is a fellow of the American Physical Society (APS) and of the American Association
            for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).<br><br>
            Like her father, she was concerned with issues
            of international security and weapons policy. She has lectured and written on
            these issues and sits on the board of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.<br>
            In 1987, she was awarded an honorary doctoral degree by Mount Holyoke College.
            She retired from MIT as professor <em>emerita</em> in 1994. Her papers are at
            MIT Library archives. `,
