        narrative: `Pheb Mitchell and her sister Maria were largely educated by their father,
            William Mitchell, a teacher, banker, and amateur astronomer. Phebe married Joshua
            Kendall, a private boys' school teacher, and moved to to Bristol, RI by 1860.
            They later settled in Cambridge.
            
            <br><br>By 1873, Joshua Kendall had opened his
            own private school for boys at 13 Appian Way in Cambridge. The family lived
            at 123 Inman Street, a modest two-story wood frame house. Mr. Kendall operated
            Kendall's Day and Family School from 1873 until 1906. From 1898 to 1906, the
            family also lived at 13 Appian Way. In 1878 Phebe accompanied her sister, the
            astronomer Maria Mitchell, and four Vassar College graduates across country
            by train to Denver Colorado to observe a total solar eclipse through the telescopes
            they had brought with them.<br><br>

            In 1879, the Massachusetts Legislature passed
            a law allowing women to vote in school committee elections. That same year,
            Phebe Mitchell Kendall and Sarah Sprague Jacob
            became the first women elected to the Cambridge School Committee. Phebe Kendall
            served until 1894. In 1896, Phebe Mitchell Kendall edited a biography of her
            sister, Maria Mitchell (1818-1889) who had made her name as astronomer, educator,
            and advocate for the education of women. (<i>Maria Mitchell: Life, Letters
                and Journals</i> (Boston 1896). <br><br>

            Phebe Kendall died in 1907. Her son, William Mitchell
            Kendall, had a distinguished career as an architect and was active in many art
            and cultural organizations. He graduated from Harvard in 1876 and studied architecture
            at MIT. From 1882 until his death in 1941 he worked for the renowned New York
            architectural firm of McKim, Mead &amp; White.

        narrative: `
            The daughter of the renowned physicist George
            B. Kistiakowsky and his Swedish wife Hildegard Moebius, Vera was interested in
            science from childhood. She attended school in Massachusetts and Pittsburgh
            and then went to Mount Holyoke College as an undergraduate where she majored
            in chemistry and took pre-med courses. <br><br>
            
            Instead of going into medicine, she went
            to graduate school in chemistry at University of California, Berkeley, obtaining
            her PhD in 1952 examining promethium isotopes. She switched to experimental
            nuclear physics, doing her postdoctoral fellowship with Luis Alvarez. While
            in graduate school, she met and married a young physicist, Gerhard Fischer with
            whom she had two children. The couple later divorced.<br><br>

            Kistiakowsky went to Columbia from 1954 to 1959
            where she worked as a research associate under the Nobel prize winner, Madame
            Chien-Shiung Wu. In 1959, she came back to Massachusetts to work at Brandeis
            University in a high-energy laboratory affiliated with MIT. In 1963, she moved
            to MIT's Laboratory for Nuclear Science. Although she had stellar credentials,
            she was appointed professor only in the early 1970s. She worked in experimental
            particle physics, and then in observational astrophysics. She published over
            one hundred articles in these fields.<br><br>

            She became interested in the position of women scientists in the late 1960s
            when she and two other women started a Boston area group called WISE (Women
            in Science and Engineering). In 1970 she organized a committee within the American
            Physical Society (APS) to study the status of women physicists. She has published
            articles and lectured on topics related to women in science. She was president
            of the Association for Women in Science in 1982 and 1983. Among other honors,
            she is a fellow of the American Physical Society (APS) and of the American Association
            for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).<br><br>

            Like her father, she was concerned with issues
            of international security and weapons policy. She has lectured and written on
            these issues and sits on the board of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.<br><Br>
            
            In 1987, she was awarded an honorary doctoral degree by Mount Holyoke College.
            She retired from MIT as professor <i>emerita</i> in 1994. Her papers are at

        Boomer Kennedy worked as a waitress, chamber maid, store detective, farm worker, social worker, and watchband 
        maker before creating a groundbreaking women-owned auto mechanics shop in Cambridge in the mid-1980s. (She had
         also gotten herself out of alcohol and cocaine addiction that began when she was 12.)
        <br><br>
        Kennedy was born in Connecticut (she was born as "Patricia", but she only allowed 
        a few people to know what her real name was), but by the mid-1970s, she had found her way to the Boston area 
        and started her studies at UMass/Boston. She dropped out by 1978 to join a friend in a watchband-making business,
         run out their Somerville home.
        <br><br>
        After working at various other jobs in the Boston area, Kennedy had the idea of being an auto mechanic, given her
         penchant for "fixing things" and enrolled at ITT Technical Institute (which was in Chelsea at the time) in auto 
         repair; she graduated in late 1983.
        <br><br>
        In 1985, Kennedy purchased Jim's Foreign Auto, at 254 Prospect Street in Cambridge, which she then ran for the 
        next 20 years. She named her new business "Chicago Auto" based on her love of that city. For the first three 
        months, her shop employed only female workers and she didn't have any male customers, but both of those things 
        soon changed. 
        <br><br>
        A February 1990 <i>Cambridge Chronicle</i> article told some of her story:
        <blockquote>
        In place of a gruff-voiced "get 'em in, get 'em out" attitude is an ease and warmth not often found in this 
        business. Responsibility for this comfortable climate rests principally 33-year-old owner and one of its three
         mechanics. Those who trust their cars to Kennedy say one of the basic tenets of her business philosophy is 
         respect for the customer's right to know. "Boomer educates people along with fixing their cars," says Sylvia 
         Sukop, a long-time customer. "Not only will she do the right thing, but she'll explain everything about why she's doing it." 
        <br><br>

        Kennedy says "Car owners have been taken advantage of for a long time because they don't know about their cars.
         I try and break their naivete barrier so they understand what's happening I chip away at their automotive illiteracy." 
        <br><br>

        "My aim has always been to fix cars, not to prove that a woman could do this,” she says. "I run a business, not 
        a political movement.” 
        </blockquote>

        In 1991, she moved her business a few blocks away to 130 Brookline Street, in Cambridge.
        <br><br>

        In 1994, Kennedy employed four mechanics and her business worked on 125 cars a month, "working under a giant
         logo of a woman stretching out her strong arms, placed over a giant upside down triangle, the symbol of gay pride."  
         In 1998, she started a series of Cambridge-based car-care seminars for women. In 1997, the City of Cambridge and M.I.T.
          honored Kennedy with the Recognition Award for Excellence in Entrepreneurship. At the time, Ray Magliozzi of NPR's 
          "Car Talk" stated, "I have never met anyone with more enthusiasm for cars or more respect for her customers than Boomer." In 1998, she received the Greater Boston Business council Award for Excellence as a Small Business.
        <br><br>

        Kennedy was a volunteer in the early 1990s in the buddy system program of the Boston AIDS Action Committee, making 
        weekly visits to a woman with AIDS.
        <br><br>

        In the 2000s, Kennedy left her business and changed careers again, becoming a pastry chef at the world-renowned
         <i>French Laundry</i>, in California. She eventually moved to New Mexico and ran a picture frame store with her life-partner Martha. 
         She died in 2024, after having moved to Baltimore, Maryland. Upon her death, a woman named Rebecca commented on 
         the Facebook page of her old high school:
         <blockquote>
         "I brought my truck to her shop while I was living and working in the Boston area. All women in the shop. 
         She was proud that I was a pipefitter and welder. She asked why is it that so many of us ended up so butch,
          I replied 'it's just a job that I enjoy, not a life style for me' (with a wink)."
