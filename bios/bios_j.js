        narrative: `
            Born into slavery in North Carolina, to Deliah
            Horniblow and Daniel Jacobs. She and her brother John were orphaned at a young
            age and became the slaves
            of the Norcom family. In order to avoid the sexual attentions of her new owner &#8220;Dr
            Flint&#8221;, she formed a liason with a white man and bore him two children
            but became fearful of their future when her lover &#8220;Mr Sands&#8221; (a
            future congressman) failed to free her children. She escaped from her lover's
            house in 1835 and spent the next seven years hiding in an attic above the storeroom
            in the house of her grandmother (a freed slave) and coming out only to see
            her children who lived in the house. During this period of hiding, she read,
            wrote and sewed. In 1842, Jacobs seized the opportunity to flee to New York
            City, where she worked as a nursemaid and saved money to arrange for her children's
            freedom. <br><br>
            Harriet, having bought her children's freedom,
            moved to Boston with them in 1845. In 1849, she moved to Rochester, and then
            to New York City to which
            her brother had also escaped. There she worked for Cynthia Willis who bought
            her freedom for three hundred dollars after Jacobs was frightened by hearing
            of the arrival of her former owner in that city. A Quaker abolitionist, Amy Post,
            urged her to write the full story of her life. Returning to Boston, she began
            to write her biography, entitled <em>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Written
                by Herself</em>. It was then edited by Lydia Child, a well known Boston-area
            writer who had strong abolitionist beliefs. Jacobs traveled to London to try
            to sell
            her manuscript, and it was finally published in 1861. After the civil war, she
            lived in Cambridge for five years, renting a house on Trowbridge street that
            she ran as a boarding house for two years for Harvard students from 1870 to 1872.
            <br><br>She then spent three additional years in a house on the corner of Story and Mount
            Auburn streets before moving to Washington D.C., where she spent the rest of
            her
            life. She is buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery.<br>

        narrative: `
            Born in Cranston, Rhode Island, Sarah Sprague
            Jacobs was the eldest child of the Reverend Bela Jacobs and Sarah (&#8220;Sally&#8221;)
            Sprague Jacobs. Rev. Jacobs was the first pastor of the First Baptist Church
            at 5 Magazine Street; he occupied the pulpit there from 1818 to 1833. In 1835,
            he became pastor of the new Second Baptist Church, but died tragically in May
            1836, aged 51, when he was thrown from a carriage. In 1837, Sarah Jacobs published
            a memoir of her father. She also wrote many poems published in various sources,
            as well as a number of books for young people, including Nonantum and Natick
            (Boston 1853), a history of the Indian tribes of New England and the missionary
            work of John Eliot among the Indians. <br><br>
            From 1818 to 1909, the Jacobs family resided at
            19 Pleasant Street, a sizable wood-frame house built for the Rev. Jacobs. After
            he died, his widow and children continued to live there; later, nieces and nephews
            expanded the household. Sarah Jacobs left Cambridge to teach in Georgia, New
            York, Rhode Island, and Nova Scotia. It is not known when she left the city,
            nor the year she returned, but she was again residing in Cambridge by 1870.
            <br><br>
            The 1870 federal census records Sarah living with
            her mother, Sarah, and sister Annie in the household of her brother, Justin
            Allen Jacobs. Also residing in the house were Sarah's sister-in-law, also Sarah,
            and Eliza Williams, a domestic servant. By 1900, the household was considerably
            smaller, comprising Sarah, her sister, a young nephew, Allen, and their servant,
            Mary Needham. Sarah Sprague's brothers were well known in Cambridge. Justin
            Allen Jacobs became City Clerk (and briefly City Auditor); Bela Farwell Jacobs
            was an attorney and warden at St. Peter's Episcopal Church. A niece, Isabel,
            was an assistant at the Cambridge Public Library; her nephew, Allen, became
            the assistant pastor at Christ Church. <br><br>
            In 1879, the Massachusetts Legislature passed
            a law allowing women to vote in school committee elections. That same year,
            Sarah Sprague Jacobs (at about age 66) and Phebe
                Mitchell Kendall became the first two women elected to the Cambridge School
            Committee. Miss Jacobs served until 1885, when she resigned. <br>
            Jacobs transcribed Cambridge's earliest public
            records and prepared the copy manuscripts for publication in two volumes. The
            first was <em>The Register Book of the Lands and Houses in the &quot;New Towne&quot;
                and the Town of Cambridge with the Records of the Proprietors of the Common
                Lands being the Records Generally Called &quot;The Proprietors Records</em>
            (1896), and the second volume was <em>The Records of the Town of Cambridge (Formerly
                Newtowne) Massachusetts 1630-1703</em>(1901). This laborious undertaking no
            doubt consumed many years of her time. She was 83 years old at the time of the
            publication of the first volume and 88 years old when the second volume was
            published. <br><br>She died at home on 14 May 1902 age 89 years and was buried at Mount
            Auburn Cemetery. `,

            Alice (Palache) Jones, daughter of Charles Palache
            and Helen (Markham) Palache, was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on April
            12, 1907 Her father was a professor of Mineralogy at Harvard and her mother
            taught at the Buckingham girl's school in Cambridge, which was organized

            Appleton Street in Cambridge. <br><br>
             She attended Bryn Mawr College, graduating in 1928.
            In the summer of 1927, she took a trip through Europe with her fellow classmate

            was hired by Margaret Sanger as executive director of the National Committee
            on Federal Legislation for Birth Control (1930-1933), a society founded by Sanger
            in 1929 to fight the federal Comstock laws against birth control. The society
            disbanded in 1936, after Judge August Hand ruled that birth control information
            was not &#8220;obscene&#8221;. <br><br>
