            Dorothy A. (Wood) Gatherwright was born in Cambridge
            in 1903 and lived her entire life in Cambridge. Her family lived on Worcester Street. 
            Dorothy learned to play the piano
            and became the accompanist to well-known contralto singer, Dorothy Richardson.
            Dorothy said, 
            
            <blockquote>
            &#8220;We went to the different colored colleges. We went from
            Maine on down south. I guess I must have met Dorothy [Richardson] at church.
            I was a born member of the church. I was taking piano lessons from William Lawrence;
            he was the accompanist of Roland Hayes.&#8221; <br>(Roland Hayes was a famous African
            American singer.) </blockquote>
            
            Dorothy played what she called &#8220;regular music&#8221;
            -- Negro spirituals and songs by black composers. According to her niece, Leora
            Littleton, Dorothy taught piano to half the children in Cambridge. She took
            organ lessons and became the organist for the Massachusetts Avenue Baptist Church's
            Sunday school and director of the choir. She was also a member of the Salvation Army Silver Threads. In 1993, Mrs. Gatherwright celebrated
            her 90th birthday at the church where she was the oldest member. At her death,
            the City of Cambridge memorialized her passing.`,

        deathLocation: "Washington, DC",
        narrative: `
            Caroline Howard was born in Boston, Massachusetts
            to Samuel Howard and Anna (Lillie) Howard. At the age of 10, she moved to Cambridge
            with her widowed mother, who died that same year; her older sister then raised
            her. Writing was Gilman's avocation from an early age and she published
            her first poem at age sixteen. She met a young Harvard College graduate, the
            clergyman, Samuel Gilman, marrying him, on September 25, 1819, in Cambridge.
            The young couple moved to Charleston, South Carolina where she remained for
            the rest of her life, adhering to the Southern cause during the Civil War. <br><br>
            In
            1832, she began to publish and edit a magazine designed for women and children
            that she called <i>The Rose</i>. It was soon renamed <i>The Southern Rose</i>,
            and was widely read throughout the country. Gilman produced most of the content
            herself in the form of poetry and children's verses and stories as well
            as serialized novels about domestic life. Highly popular, her writings and her
            magazine supplemented the family's income that was strained by the birth
            of seven children born between 1820 and 1840.<br><br>

            Her first novel, <i>Recollections of a Housekeeper</i>,
            written under the pseudonym, Clarissa Packard, portrayed women's lives
            in New England, described by her as at odds with that of the South. In her heavily
            autobiographical <i>Recollections of a Southern Matron</i>, written in 1838,
            she objected to the fashionable Southern belle as a woman defined by men and
            suggested other modes of behavior. She used her writing to comment on the societies
            of North and the South, comparing and contrasting their views of the domestic
            realm. <br><br>

            In spite of the success of her novels and other
            writings, she reacted against her creative output and ceased to produce much
            original material after she lost her seventh child in 1840. Until her death,
            she wrote only occasional pieces and poems although she continued to republish
            her earlier poetry and children's verses from her literary journal in
            a series of volumes through the 1850s. Her limited output in the 1860s and 1870s
            emphasized historical events from the period of the Revolutionary War.

            Goddard-Cambridge, an extension of the parent program of Goddard College in
            Vermont, had several locations throughout Cambridge and eventually found its home at 186 Hampshire Street.
            Throughout Goddard-Cambridge&rsquo;s history, programs offered included: <i>Feminist Studies, Imperial U.S. at
            Home and Abroad, Third World Studies</i>, and <I>U.S. Social &amp; Cultural Studies</i>. 
            
            <br><br>Students participated in both
            faculty led and student-developed research and earned a Masters in Arts within one year for between $1500 -
            $2500. The &ldquo;People&rsquo;s Council&ldquo; made up of faculty and students, governed the school and
            decided on internal policy issues. Goddard&rsquo;s Mission stated: 
            
            <blockquote>&ldquo;It will provide the training and
            certification for those interested in combining the theory and practice of social change; for those whose
            educational goals cannot be pursued in the established universities and conventional graduate programs; and
            for those presently engaged in social action who desire to deepen their intellectual resources.&rdquo;
            </blockquote>

            Student projects included titles such as: Black Women &amp; American Society, Corporate Power &amp;
            The Issues of Women, Design for a Community Mental Health Course, Feminist Writing Workshop, Lesbian
            Culture, Media: The Information Industry, Pawnee Women: Speaking for Ourselves, Prostitution As A Form of
            Female Labor, Study of Menopause, Theory and Practice of Feminist Journalism, Towards a Feminist Theory of
            Sexuality, Women &amp; Therapy, and Women &amp; Traditional Music.<br><br>

            In 1970 the school hosted its first women&rsquo;s history ovular (Goddard's feminist word
            for seminar), taught by Linda Gordon, who became a nationally recognized historian. The group met twice a
            week for 3-5 hours and held the motto &ldquo;make the invisible visible.&rdquo; The program officially
            recognized feminist studies as a graduate program in the fall of 1972. From 1974-78 the program was led by
            Rochelle Ruthchild and by 1976, two-thirds of the student population had enrolled in the Feminist Studies
            program.<br><br>

            An ovular on lesbian culture, possibly the first in the country, was offered
            to students in 1976. Leaflets for the course traveled by mail across the country and caused controversy that
            led to calls to the Massachusetts Board of Education. Faculty members recall that the evaluation of
            Goddard-Cambridge included questions suggesting that the school was trying to convince students to become
            lesbians and Marxists. The idea of sexual orientation as a lifestyle choice was, and still is, prevalent in
            society. <br><br>

            Though Goddard-Cambridge closed in 1979, its impact continues. In 1990 the
            first Women&rsquo;s Studies Ph.D. degree was offered at Emory University thanks in part to the work of
            feminist and women&rsquo;s studies programs in the 70s and 80s. Today, women&rsquo;s studies are viewed as
            essential learning to many sociology, psychology, and history programs. Cambridge housed one of the first
            feminist studies programs in the country at the Goddard-Cambridge Graduate Program in Social Change.
            Furthermore, the demands and concerns of the present day #MeToo movement have long been present in feminist
            writing, organizing, and services. Freada Klein, a faculty member at Goddard-Cambridge and a Cambridge
            resident, received funding for her research on sexual harassment in the workplace. 
            
            <br><br>In 1976 along with
            Elizabeth Cohn-Stuntz and Lynn Wehrli, she founded the Alliance Against Sexual Coercion, which referred
            women to legal, vocational, and emotional counseling resources, in addition to helping determine their
            eligibility for unemployment compensation. Other groups provided domestic violence support and rape crisis
            interventions. Each of the founders was involved in education, both locally and nationally. Lynn co-taught a
            course titled &ldquo;Rape and U.S. Institutions&rdquo; at the Women&rsquo;s School, located at the Cambridge
            Women&rsquo;s Center. Elizabeth and Freada collaborated with the Feminist Alliance Against Rape which
            published national bi-monthly newsletters.`,

            attended both Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, New York, and Columbia University
            in New York City, but dropped out of both schools before obtaining her degree.
             She has one son and lived  and worked
            in Cambridge part of each year.<br><br>

            In 1986, her first book of poetry <i>Firstborn</i>
            was published and received the Academy of American Poet's Prize. This collection
            was known for its variety of first-person personae, all disaffected or angry.
            Her next book <i>The House on the Marshland</i>, 1975, included historical
            and fairytale characters such as Joan of Arc and Gretel (of Hansel and Gretel).
            In 1980, she published <i>Descending Figure </i>with various imaginative personae.
            In 1985, her book of poetry, <i>The Triumph of Achilles</i> appeared, which
            won the National Book Critics Circle Award, The <i>Boston Globe</i> Literary
            Press Award, and the Poetry Society of the America's Melville Kane Award. In
            1990, her fifth book was published entitled <i>Ararat</i>, which won the Rebekah

            <br><br>She began to write long poems with
            sequences connecting to tell a single story. <i>Ararat</i> deals with a family
            of three women in the aftermath of the death of a husband and a father. Her
            next book written as a series of poems, <i>Wild Iris</i>, was published in
            1992 and won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1993 and the Poetry Society of
            the America's William Carlos William Award. She published three more books of
            poetry, <i>Meadowlands</i>, written in 1996, <i>Vita Nova</i> in 1999, and
            The Seven Ages in 2001 (she was living on Ellsworth Park in Cambridge at the time). She also wrote a book of essays on poetry entitled <i>Proofs
                and Theories: Essays on Poetry</i> in 1994, that won the PEN/Martha Albrand
            Award for Nonfiction.

            Miriam Anne (Schaeffer) Goodman was born in Queens
            New York to Samuel and Rebecca (Perkis) Schaeffer. She attended high school
            in Queens and then married her high school sweetheart, Robert Goodman at the
            age of eighteen with whom she had two daughters, Sarah Anna and Julia Helen.
            The couple moved to the Cambridge area (11 Donnell Street), and Miriam studied English at Brandeis
            University. <br><br>
            
            After a decade, the couple divorced. Miriam pursued her love of
            poetry by joining poetry workshops and working with the Cambridge poetry collective,
            Alice James Books, from the early 1970s to
            the early 1980s. She published two books of poetry with the press, <i>Permanent
                Wave</i> (1977) and <i>Signal :: Noise</i> (1982). She also polished her
            craft at a number of art colonies including the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown,
            Ragdale, in Chicago, and the famed McDowell Colony in Peterborough, New Hampshire.
            Realizing that poetry never pays the rent, she became a technical writer and
            worked in that capacity at a number of high tech corporations in the Boston
            area, including Lincoln Labs from the late 1970s to the 1990s, writing manuals
            and serving as a digital technical instructor. She drew on this experience for
            some of her later poetry. <br><br>
            In August 1993, Goodman published the following, in the journal <i>Poetry</i>:
            
            <blockquote>
                        Anxiety of Ten O'Clock<br>
            Miriam Goodman<br>

            Account for all the work.<br>
            Do the arithmetic: this much finish<br>
            day by day. Feel better. You feel<br>
            you're holding cats under a rug.<br>
            You balk, refuse your own assignments,<br>
            stalk reunion with your other,<br>
            lazy self, this one harnessed<br>
            in a soggy woolen swimsuit, body<br>
            doughy under puzzle straps. She asks<br>
            her one repeating question as if<br>
            what you have said definitively were<br>
            still unclear. In different ways she asks:<br>
            always a but, always a what if.<br>
            Always impossible to finish.<br>
            </blockquote>

            In her fifties, Goodman developed her skills as a
            photographer, studying at the Photography Atelier program of the Radcliffe and
            Lesley Seminars and at the New England School of Photography. She sought images
            in unusual locations such as elevators and construction sites, and soon exhibited
            throughout the New England area, often coupling her images with poetry. Her
            photographic work appeared in many juried group exhibitions at the Cambridge
            Art Association, Tufts University, Lesley University, the Griffin Museum of
            Photography, and the Nelson Gallery (N.H.) between 1994 and 2006. She founded
            and coordinated the Word &amp; Image Lecture series, sponsored by Lesley Seminars
            and The Center for Photographic Exhibition of the New England School of Photography.
            She also served as Photography Editor for the <i>Women's Review of Books</i>
            and Poetry Editor for <i>Sojourner</i> newspaper, Boston.
            <br><br>

            While she continued to publish individual poems
            in various publications over the years, in 1996 she published a third book of
            poetry, <i>Commercial Traveler</i>, with Garden Street Press of Truro, Massachusetts.
            More recently, she edited an anthology of poems for the online magazine <i>Frigate</i>
            (http://www.frigatezine.com, Issue 2 November 2000 - September 2001), entitled
            <i>Night Shift: Poets on Work</i>. Her photographs illustrating the subject
            of work appeared throughout this issue. In 2007, she contributed a permanent
            traveling collection to the Griffin Museum of Photography. <br><br>

            Suffering from metastatic melanoma, she began
            to keep a &#8220;Radiation journal&#8221; which she illustrated with photographs.

        narrative: `
            Alice Bache Gould was born in Cambridge on January
            5, 1868 to the astronomer Benjamin Apthorp Gould and his wife Mary Apthorp Quincy
            Gould. The Gould family resided at 12 Oxford Street in Cambridge. The house,
            built in the 1840s, was demolished in 1926 for Harvard's construction of Mallinckrodt
            Laboratory. As a very young child, she lived in Cordoba Argentina where her
            father was astronomer at the National Observatory but she returned to Cambridge
            in 1871 to live with relatives. She always credited her New England roots for
            her resolute personality but she kept an interest in Spanish culture.<br><br>

            As a young woman, she determined to become a mathematician
            and studied at the early version of Radcliffe College in 1885. She then transferred
            to Bryn Mawr from which she received an A.B. in mathematics in 1889. She then
            began graduate work at Massachusetts of Technology and at Newnham College, Cambridge
            in England. She then began a doctorate at the University of Chicago under to
            study for her doctorate in mathematics with E. H. Moore and received a fellowship
            in 1895. The death of her father the following year and the loss of her fellowship
            caused her to drop out of her doctoral program and return to Cambridge. Although
            she taught mathematics occasionally, she never completed her degree. She established
            a fellowship in her father's name at the Academy of Sciences. She also
            wrote and published a biography of the naturalist Louis Agassiz in 1900.<br><br>

            Her life took a new direction when she traveled
            to Puerto Rico to recover from the flu. She became interest in the earliest
            voyages of exploration and to research information on the first sailors to risk
            the Atlantic crossing. During seven years in Puerto Rico and forty-two years
            in Spain, notably in the Archivo de Simancas, she rescued countless original
            documents from destruction. Her greatest accomplishment as a scholar was the
            compilation of the names and biographies of all the members of the crew of Christopher
            Columbus' first voyage. In 1942, famed Harvard historian Samuel Eliot Morison
            called her work, &quot;the most important piece of original Columbian research
            yet done in this century.&quot;<br><br>

            Although historical research was Gould's lifetime
            passion, it was not her only accomplishment or legacy. She was instrumental
            in establishing a nurses' training hospital in Puerto Rico, and she founded
            the first pre-school in 
            Simancas, Spain. She taught at universities across the United States and even
            taught navigation to ensigns during World War I at the Great Lakes Naval Training
            Center. Although she briefly left Spain during the Spanish Civil War, she soon
            returned there. Gould left behind permanently endowed scholarship funds and
            bequeathed huge collections in both the United States and Spain. The government
            of Spain awarded her the Queen Isabella cross in 1952. She died in Simancas,
            Spain on July 25, 1953. In October 2003, fifty years after her death, a two-day
            international celebration in Madrid recognized Miss Gould's life and accomplishments.
            The event was organized by Kathleen E. LeMieux, who is currently writing a biography
            of Alice Bache Gould for publication. `,

        deathLocation: "Cambridge, Massachusetts",
        narrative: `
            Saundra Graham was born in Cambridge, one of eleven
            children of Charles B. Postell and Roberta (Betts) Postell. She attended public
            schools in Cambridge, the University of Massachusetts and Harvard University
            Extension. She married at a young age, but by the late 1960s, Saundra was divorced
            and continued to raise her five children as a single parent. She lived at 5 Putnam Gardens, near Western Avenue.
            
            <br><br>
            In 1968, Saundra became a member of the Board
            of Directors of the Cambridge Community Center. In 1970, she served as president
            of the Riverside Planning Team and in 1971, as one of the founders and the president
            of Riverside Cambridgeport Community Development Corporation. She led this organization
            to become a highly successful community development corporation that continues
            to provide low and moderate income housing for Cambridge residents and acts
            to upgrade existing housing. She also led the struggle for rent control in the
            early 1970s. <br><br>

            Graham became widely known for her leadership
            of neighborhood residents in a protest, during the 1970 Harvard University commencement,
            against the university's real estate expansion that resulted in the eviction
            of long-time residents from their homes. The group succeeded in forcing Harvard
            to construct both elderly and family housing complexes over the next ten years.
            She has continued to the present to challenge the creation of Harvard buildings
            in areas of the Riverside neighborhood of Cambridge. <br><br>

            In 1971, she became the first woman of color to be elected to the Cambridge City
            Council. From 1972 to the 1980s, she
            served as Chairwoman of its Housing and Land Use Committee. From 1976 to 1977,
            Graham served as Vice-Mayor of Cambridge. As City Councilor and later State
            Representative, she played a key role in obtaining federal housing dollars for
            Cambridge that resulted in rehabilitation and modernization of public housing
            complexes. Through her work, one building in the historic East Cambridge courthouse
            complex was saved from demolition and opened as a center for Multicultural Arts.
            In 1977 and 1978, she served as Chairwoman of the Multicultural Arts Center
            Committee in Cambridge. <br><br>

            In 1976, Saundra Graham was elected as State Representative,
            a seat which she held for the subsequent twelve years. She was the first black
            woman representative from Cambridge to the State House and served as Chairwoman
            of the Massachusetts Black Legislative Caucus and as a member of the Massachusetts
            Caucus of Women Legislators. She continued to work for fair housing as a member
            of the Joint House-Senate Committee on Housing and Urban Development. In her
            work in the legislature, Saundra was dedicated to obtaining economic justice
            for the poor, the elderly, the unemployed, minorities and women. She also served
            as Secretary to the National Black Caucus of Local Elected Officials. 
            
            <br><br>
            Another major concern of hers was the need for
            quality childcare in the Commonwealth. She founded the Childcare Coalition,
            a state-wide collective of community child advocacy groups and individuals.
            She also has worked on peace initiatives and advocated for nuclear disarmament,
            co-chairing the Massachusetts Coalition for the August 27, 1983 March on Washington.<br><Br>

            Graham is a recipient of numerous awards some
            of which include the 1976 National Sojourner Truth Award from the National Association
            of Negro Business and Professional Women's Clubs, Inc.; the 1980 Recognition
            Award by the Central Square Cambridge Businessmen's Association and the 1982
            Woman of the Year in Government Award by the Boston Chapter of the National
            Organization for Women. <br><br>

            Graham was always outspoken as a City Councilor. In 1980, when the Alewife area was
             still quite industrial, Graham responded to issues around re-zoning the area and 
             the impact on blue-collar jobs:

            <blockquote>
            "[I no longer] care what kind of jobs we create, just as long as unemployed and underemployed 
            people get jobs with upward mobility. It's not an issue if they are blue-collar or white-collar
            or pink-collar. The issue is how can we train them to put them in the positions. Are we talking 
            about jobs or fighting for the old kinds of plants to come back to the area?"
            </blockquote>

            The Graham and Parks Alternative Public School
            was named in her honor, along with Rosa Parks. Her portrait appears with that
            of Rosa Parks in a mural &quot;Education Is Liberation / The Rosa Parks Mural,&quot;
            on the first floor of the school's former building at 44 Upton Street.
            This was created in 1984 by artist David Fichter on a commission from the Cambridge
            Arts Council. When she was no longer an elected official, she continued to
            be an important political figure, fighting against unfair practices such as
            the recent redistricting of the Cambridge legislative seats.`,

        narrative: `
            Renae Gray,
            daughter of Anlizia and Robert Gray, was born on April 19, 1951 in Portsmouth, Virginia and grew up in
            Virginia and New Haven, Connecticut with her aunt Elnora Doggett. She graduated from Woodrow Wilson High
            School in Portsmouth, Virginia, and moved to Florida where she met and married Edward Scott. In 1973,
            Gray moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, eventually settling in the &ldquo;Port&rdquo; neighborhood, also
            known as Area IV, with her daughter Michele N. Scott.<br><br>

            Early in
            her career, Gray worked at a shelter for battered women, and she remained committed to ending violence
            against women and girls throughout her life. She also worked at the Haymarket Peoples Fund, a social
            justice, grant-making nonprofit, and served on the boards of the Margaret Fuller Neighborhood House
            (MFNH), the Women&rsquo;s Theological Center and the Cambridge Algebra Project</span>. <br><br>

           In the early
            1980s, a large group of women met to address the declining support of women-led organizations and the
            closing of two feminist newspapers. In a 2008 </span>Boston Herald interview, Gray reflected on those
            early meetings: 
            
            <blockquote>
            &ldquo;Out of that came the question: How do we sustain women&rsquo;s organizations? How do
            we guarantee the viability and ability of women&rsquo;s work? We went around and around. We knew we
            couldn&rsquo;t fund all the social services that women needed.&rdquo;</blockquote>
            
            In 1984, Gray was one of eight women
            from that initial group who founded the Boston Women&rsquo;s Fund (BWF) to support organizations that help
            low-income women and girls on issues related to racial, economic and social justice. Twenty years later, she
            was asked to join the Board and become the Interim Executive Director, where she served for five years,
            pursuing her belief that a small monthly pledge was as significant as a large donation. Gray said in that
            same interview, &ldquo;I hope that the mark that the fund leaves is that it holds and honors both of those
            donors.&rdquo; <br><br>

           Gray also helped
            found the Funding Exchange, a national grant making foundation, and she served as a board member or was
            part of many organizations, including the Cambridge Health Alliance, New England Blacks in Philanthropy
            (NEBiP), the Cambridge African American Heritage Committee, the Area IV for Peace Committee, the Union
            Baptist Church of Cambridge, the Women&rsquo;s Theological Center and the Cambridge Civic Unity
            Committee. She worked on a project for seniors, &ldquo;Seven Secrets for Healthy Living&rdquo;, with the
            MFNH and the Cambridge Public Health Department. Throughout her career, she consulted on diversity
            training and advocacy, and traveled extensively for her work, including serving as an international
            monitor for the first presidential election after apartheid ended in South Africa.</span><br><br>

            Gray was also the
            Chair of the Board of Trustees of the YWCA Cambridge, and in 2010, she received the Lieutenant Kenney
            Award for her commitment to safety and prosperity for the Area IV Cambridge community (she was living at 
            84 Columbia Street at the time). Gray dedicated
            her entire career and life to helping others, especially women, African Americans and fellow
            Cantabrigians.</span>`,

        narrative: `
            Suzanne Revaleon Green, born in 1912 to
            James Albert Revaleon and Ruby Higginbotham, was a lifelong resident of Cambridge.
            She lived at 9 Worcester Street at a home in The Port neighborhood. A former teacher,
            she was known for her keen love for and knowledge of history. The Revaleon family
            has an interesting history and is highlighted in <i>Twenty Families of Color
                in Massachusetts, 1742&#8211;1998</i> by Frank Dorman.<br><br>

            Her grandfather Albert Leroy Revaleon enlisted
            in the 55th regiment in the Civil War, a regiment of Black soldiers formed after
            the famous 54th was oversubscribed. Her father's mother was one of five
            children born to James Belden, an Indian scout of the
            Nipmuc tribe in Northfield, Massachusetts, a territory seized from the Indians
            without compensation. <br><br>

            She recalls that her maternal grandfather
            sold fruits and vegetables from his horse and wagon and ran a store in Cambridge,
            selling grains, beans, and flour. He gave her grandmother the house at 9 Worcester
            Street in the 1880s as a wedding present. She recalls being a member of the
            Cambridge Neighborhood House and the Margaret
                Fuller House, where she took piano lessons and then played. She attended
            the Fletcher school, graduating at the top of her class, but was at first blocked
            from speaking at the graduation because of her race. When her father objected
            strongly, a concession was made to allow her to speak. Her father was a man
            who did not believe in being blocked by racial prejudice, and when he was not
            welcomed in the white Masonic Lodges, he started a Masonic Lodge for young African
            Americans in 1937.<br><br>

            Suzanne continued her education at Cambridge High
            and Latin and then went on to Salem State Teacher's College, graduating
            in 1933. Although she and her &#8220;colored&#8221; classmates were encouraged
            to seek positions in the South, Suzanne stayed in Cambridge and was the seventh
            Black woman to be hired in the Cambridge Public schools since the time of Maria
                Baldwin. In 1937, she was appointed to the Houghton School.<br><br>

            Five years later, when she decided to get married,
            she was fired from her position along with two other recently married women,
            one Catholic and one Jewish. Her new husband, the attorney Robert H. Green,
            sued the city contending that the firing had been illegal. The battle dragged
            on, but it was resolved in their favor and all three women were reinstated and
            awarded their back pay. Green decided to resign (as she had initially planned
            to do before the firing, but the other women continued to teach in the schools.
            It was some years more before the law was changed and all married women were
            permitted to teach in the schools.<br><br>

            Green has served and volunteered for the Girl Scouts, the Cambridge Community
            Center, and the Cambridge YWCA. She worked for
            11 years as assistant director of training from the OIC (Boston office of Opportunities
            Industrialization Center), a movement begun by a group of ministers in the 1960s
            to increase working possibilities for African Americans. In the 1960s, she was
            also one of those who fought to prevent the proposed Inner Belt highway from
            destroying much of Central Square.<br><br>

            Devoted to her community, she is depicted in the
            top left-hand corner of the mural behind the Harvest Cooperative Supermarket
            in Central Square. In 2002, on her ninetieth birthday, she was awarded the key
            to the City of Cambridge. Since then, she compiled a booklet entitled <i>African American
                Women&#8212;Firsts </i>that celebrates in words and photographs the accomplishments
            of Black women U.S. history. She served as a member of the Cambridge African
            American Heritage Trail Committee and the Cambridge Historical Commission, and
            in 2004 she was the first recipient of the Margaret Fuller Lifetime Achievement
            Award at the 17th Annual YWCA Tribute to Outstanding Women and an invited guest
            at a conference on &#8220;Slavery, Freedom and Abolition&#8221; in New England
            at Yale University.<br><br>

            Mrs. Green died February 10, 2012 at the age of
            99. `,

            Gypsy Wagon, a craft collective that operated on consignment, was led by Diane
            Walbridge, Diane Bellamy, and Karen Copeland. They periodically held craft sales at the Joy of 
            Movement Center, at 536 Mass. Ave.<br><br>
            
            Aside from selling crafts, Gypsy Wagon offered classes
            including macram&eacute;, knitting, crochet, loom weaving, basket weaving, lampshade workshops, as well as
            voice and music lessons. As in other collectives, the people involved were volunteers. The shop employed one
            paid staff person. Sadly, the collective&rsquo;s inventory was robbed within its first year of operation. In
            1979, the owners changed the business to Dirtworks, a cleaning company.

        narrative: `
          Long-time Cambridge resident Yvonne Gittens has had an impactful life, maintaining strong ties to her 
          community and making a difference through her work at both the Cambridge Community Center and the
           Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While her family has been in Cambridge for more than 100 
           years, she is proud of her family's roots in Barbados and her connection to the local Barbadian 
           community. <br><br>

        Yvonne's grandparents migrated to Cambridge and her parents were both born there in the 1920s. 
        Yvonne attended the Cambridge public schools (Houghton Elementary on Putnam Avenue and 
        then Cambridge High and Latin School) and she later earned her undergraduate degree from Lesley 
        University and her Master's Degree from Harvard University's School of Education.<br><br>

        Yvonne's connections to the Cambridge Community Center (CCC) are deep. The CCC was founded in 
        1929 by a group of Cambridge Black pastors, who established their programs in an old school 
        building on Callendar Street. The organization was a reaction to the local YMCA's whites-only
        policy at the time. The CCC was set up to provide a variety of youth programs and family 
        support initiatives. Yvonne's parents attended programs at CCC when they were young and by 
        the time Yvonne was in grade school, she had become a regular there, as would her own children and grandchildren 
        (they would all be called "Center Kids").<br><br>

        Yvonne was on the Board of Directors of the Cambridge Community Center for over thirty years 
        (she stepped down in 2019). Yvonne served as a teacher, the Board of Directors treasurer, secretary, 
        and president, as well as an interim director of the entire program. Today, Yvonne continues
        her work with CCC on a volunteer basis, meeting with and giving advice to high school seniors 
        and their families, serving as a member of the Sister to Sister Community Conversations Committee, 
        which provides "informational workshops on issues impacting women of color, their families and 
        their lives" and science and cooking teacher. Her commitment to CCC and community involvement is
        such that she recently quipped her daughters joke that "If she's not home, she's at the CCC. 
        If she's not at the CCC, she's at church."<br><br>

        Yvonne's work life also followed a very interesting path. She spent her entire career at M.I.T., 
        beginning in 1965. In the oral history book, <i>Technology and the Dream: Reflections on the Black 
        Experience at M.I.T., 1941-1999</i>, by Clarence G. Williams, Yvonne stated: "All of my grandmother's 
        children were born in Cambridge, literally within walking distance to M.I.T. My mother always 
        worked in factories until she came to work at M.I.T." (her mother worked as a payroll accountant 
        there). When Yvonne applied for a job at M.I.T. in 1965, she didn't know if a Cambridge African American 
        girl with a high school diploma would be considered. She got the job—as a clerk in the Personnel 
        Department. Yvonne later used M.I.T.'s tuition assistance program to get her bachelor's degree and 
        eventually pursued and achieved a master's degree in education—she was ready to start a new career 
        as a teacher. But M.I.T. offered her a position as the Assistant Director of Financial Aid, which 
        she accepted. By 1986, she was promoted to Associate Director of Financial Aid. She embraced her
        role in helping needy students navigate the complex web of financial aid requirements and to help 
        them achieve their dreams.<br><br>

        Yvonne served as a member of the first committee to work on Cambridge's African American Heritage 
        Trail Project in the 1990s. Yvonne's work and dedication have been recognized by many organizations 
        over the years, including M.I.T.'s Martin Luther King, Jr. Achievement Award in 1989 and their President's 
        Award for Community Service in 1994, as well as the 2019 Janet "Ms. K" Kendrick Sisters of the Center
        Award. Yvonne is currently (2025) serving on the board of <i>Black History In Action</i>, a Cambridge-based organization that has 
        worked to convert St. Augustine's African Orthodox Church in Cambridge (established in the 1920s) 
        into a community and arts center.<br><br>
