        narrative: `
        In 1973, Barbara Ackermann became the first woman to serve as mayor of Cambridge.
        Born in Stockholm on March 1, 1925, she grew up in France and graduated from Smith
        College. According to her daughter, Joan Ackermann, she was "a savvy politician who
        could compromise but knew what she was aiming for and held to the path."
        Known for never backing down in
        her efforts to advocate for the disenfranchised, she embodied the term "social justice
        warrior."<Br><br>

        She was a member of the Cambridge School Committee from 1962 to 1968, when she
        was elected to the City Council. After her term as mayor, she returned to her seat on the
        City Council and remained a member until 1977. In her memoir, she said of Cambridge:<blockquote>
        "What is most special about Cambridge is its wild diversity. Even our streets won't settle down to a tidy pattern." </blockquote>
        

        As a newly elected councillor, she joined the opposition to the state's Inner Belt highway 
        plan that would raze Brookline and Elm streets, along with 1,300 working class residents' homes.
        Asked to help publicize the opposition, she donned a Paul Revere style tricorner hat and 
        rode a horse through Cambridgeport to City Hall, to the calls of "Citizens of Cambridge! 
        Save Our City! The highway is coming!" The residents prevailed; the project was canceled in 1972.

        In 1972, Ackermann was also  a delegate to the Democratic National Convention from
        Massachusetts. In 1989, she wrote an account of her experiences as a Cambridge
        politician in a book entitled, <em>"You the Mayor?: The Education of a City Politician"</em>, which
        offers insights into political life and the functioning of a city. In her memoir, she explained:<blockquote>
        "Like most of my colleagues, I wanted to be a link between citizens and city government and
         to help the bureaucracy see their responsibilities in human terms. Among my special goals
          were better schools, better police work, better public housing."</blockquote> She was also active
        as chair of the Massachusetts non-profit organization Universal Health Care Education
        Fund (UHCEF), part of MASS-CARE.<br><br>

        Barbara Ackermann lived at 41 Gibston Street and was the daughter of Benjamin Hulley, of the United States Foreign
        Service, and Joan Carrington. In 1946, she married Paul Ackermann, a Boston
        University professor of German, who died in 2011.

        narrative: ` 
            Eleanor Hallowell Abbott was raised in a literary and religious family, first on Channing Street and later on Dana Street in Cambridge. She
            attended Cambridge private schools and Radcliffe College, then worked as a secretary at the Lowell State Normal School,
            a teacher's college. 
            <br><br>
            In her early 20s, Eleanor wrote travel accounts for the <i>Boston Journal</i>, including descriptions of trips to California.  Eleanor 
            eventually became a teacher
            at the State Normal School in Lowell and at that point began to write poems and short stories. In 1892, her short story
            "Medium's Merry Christmas" won the <i>Cambridge Tribune</i> Prize (a local newspaper at the time). In 1905, she won the <i>
            Collier's Weekly</i> first prize in "Latest Fiction contest."
            Her writing career began in earnest
            when two of her poems were accepted by <i>Harper's Magazine</i> in 1909.

            <br><Br>
            Her writing brought her a measure of popularity in the 1910s and 1920s when she
            produced seventy-five short stories and fourteen "unblushingly romantic" novels about
            young women, from <i>Molly Make-Believe</i> in 1910 to <i>But Once A Year: Christmas Stories</i> in 1928.
            In 1936, she wrote an autobiography about her childhood in Cambridge,
            entitled "Being Little in Cambridge When Everyone Else Was Big", which was reviewed by <i>Time Magazine</i> and <i>The New York Times</i>.
          <br><Br> In her memoir, she wrote of her childhood home on Channing Street. The street was...
          <blockquote>"Straight as a good child running an errand,
           it ran direct from one of the main thoroughfares of the city to another, but beyond the fact of stopping at our house, to deliver
           mail or milk, a newspaper or a caller, it served no special purpose apparently except insomuch as it helped to connect the brains
           of Brattle Street with the brawn of Mt. Auburn Street, and deliver in turn the brawn of Mt. Auburn Street to the brains of Brattle 
           Street again."</blockquote>
            
            In 1908, upon her marriage to Dr. Fordyce Coburn, she moved to Wilton, N.H. Some of
            her typescripts and correspondence are held at the University of New Hampshire.
            <br><Br>
           
            Hallowell Abbot's father was a clergyman, Edward Abbott. He was rector at St. James
            Episcopal Church and edited a journal <i>Literary World</i>. Her grandfather, Jacob Abbott,
            was a friend of Longfellow and a writer of children's stories.

            Born in Ireland, Mary Manning went to London to
            study theater when she was 16 years old. After returning to Ireland, she worked
            as an actress and playwright in the 1920s and 1930s at the renowned Abbey Theater
            and the Gate Theater in Dublin; she also wrote film criticism for the <em>Irish Statesman</em>.
            Two of her plays were produced at the Abbey Theater, and she worked collaboratively
            on several projects with the playwright Samuel Beckett, who had been her childhood
            friend. In 1935, she emigrated to Boston and married Mark De Wolfe Howe, a lawyer
            who became a professor at Harvard Law School. Her three daughters were raised
            in Cambridge. <Br><br>While in Cambridge (they lived at 25 Brattle Street), Mary Manning Howe wrote the novel, <em>Mount
                Venus</em> (1938), and was the drama director at Radcliffe College during World
            War II. She helped found the Poet's Theater in Cambridge, which produced
            some of Yeats' early plays and produced work by new playwrights in the
            1950s. After the death of her husband in 1967, she returned to Dublin as theater
            critic for <em>The Irish Times</em>. In 1980, she returned to Cambridge and
            married her lawyer, Faneuil Adams.<br>
            <br>
            Her writings include the novel <em>The Last Chronicles
                of Ballyfungus</em> (1978), a humorous view of the Anglo-Irish gentry, and the
            play <em>Go Lovely Rose</em>, based on the life of Rose Kennedy, produced as
            a one woman show at the Fourth International Women Playwright's Conference
            held in Galway shortly before her death at the age of 93.<br><br>
             Her former employer, the Irish Times,
            had this to say about her upon her death (they referred to her as "Molly" in Ireland):<blockquote>
            "A part of Dublin remained with her all her always even as she became a doyenne of Cambridge cultural 
            and academic life. But she was essentially the creation of her own imagination, and stories of her 
            life were often suited to that imagination. The parties in her apartment overlooking the Charles River
             in Cambridge were the settings for some of her finest hours on stage.<Br><br>
            Molly had an acerbic wit and a quick silver mind, and no one was safe from her darts and arrows. She delighted 
            in the company of her large family and her many friends here in the Boston area, and just two weeks before her 
            death she hosted one of her famous Sunday night soirees in the reception room of her retirement home. There was 
            music and laughter, talk and gaiety, good food and good wine, and in the midst of it all was Molly, holding forth.
            It will be good to remember her this way, but I shall miss my phone ringing in the mornings and Molly's voice, 
            still with faint traces of her Irish accent, saying: 'Hello, darling. How's your love life?'"
                        
            </blockquote>
            
            
            One daughter, Susan
            Howe (born in 1937), went on to become a well-known poet and professor at State
            University of New York, Buffalo.  Her daughter Fanny Howe became a novelist
            and poet, teaching creative writing at MIT and Tufts and at University of California,
            San Diego.  She also published novels that depicted the Cambridge and Boston area in
            the 1970s. Her correspondence
            with Samuel Beckett is held in the Samuel Beckett Collection at the University
            of Texas, Austin, and her correspondence with her daughters at the University
            of California, San Diego.

            In 1850, Elizabeth Cabot Cary married Louis
            Agassiz, founder of the Museum of Comparative
            Zoology at Harvard, where he was a teacher. She
            took on the role of stepmother to his three
            children by his first marriage. Five years later, she
            opened a girls' school in their home at 36 Quincy
            Street, Cambridge, where Agassiz and a number
            of other Harvard professors lectured. Until 1863,
            when the closed, it provided a small income and
            addressed the need for the education of young
            women. Elizabeth Agassiz took notes on her
            husband's lectures and published introductory
            texts on natural history with her stepson, the
            oceanographer and natural historian, Alexander
            Agassiz. <br><Br>
            
            In 1865, she co-authored a record of her
            husband's expedition to Brazil, <EM>A Journey in Brazil</EM>. She wrote the introduction, which began this way:
            <blockquote>
            In the winter of 1865 it became necessary for me, on account of some disturbance of my health, to seek 
            a change of scene and climate, with rest from work. Europe was proposed; but though there is much 
            enjoyment for a naturalist in contact with the active scientific life of the Old World, there is 
            little intellectual rest. Toward Brazil I was drawn by a lifelong desire.
            </blockquote>
            "Later, she served as scribe for the Hassler
            Expedition (1872), providing the only account of
            her husband's last theories on glaciation. After
            Louis Agassiz's death in 1873, Elizabeth joined six
            other women in an attempt to persuade Harvard
            to open its doors to women. The result was the
            Harvard Annex, founded in 1879, which later

            became Radcliffe College. She used her influence
            to convince those who believed that women
            students should be offered the same courses as
             men and be taught by the same
            professors. At the age of 72, she accepted the first
            presidency of Radcliffe and remained at its head
            until 1902. Shortly before her death she moved
            from Cambridge to Arlington Heights, where she
            died in 1907 at the age of seventy-five."

            Cambridge-based Carol Bonomo Albright is an editor and historian.  She was brought up in Greenwich Village in New York City, the daughter of 
            Italian Immigrants Margaret (Guerrieri)
            and Salvator Bonomo.  She has written extensively on the experiences of Italian-American women, including in several journals and anthologies.<Br><Br>
            
            In 1989 she was tapped to be the editor and publisher of 
            <em>Italian Americana: Cultural and Historial Review</em>, a journal dedicated to exploring the 
            Italian emigrant/immigrant experience, and she remained in that position for 25 years.
        
         <br><Br>
            Albright also co-authored and edited with Elvira G. Di Fabio the book <em>Republican Ideals

            <Br><Br>She also served two terms as vice president of the American Italian Historical Association.<Br><Br>

            women from three different time periods and places:
        <blockquote>
        "It says a lot about Carol Bonomo Albright's skill that in this novel about three women in three
        very different historical epochs, ward politics in 1970s Rhode Island becomes as compelling as 
        Resistance activity in WWII Italy and sexual politics in 17th-century Rome. An impressive fictional 
        debut from one of the great champions of contemporary Italian American writing."<Br>
        — <i>Anthony Giardina (author of White Guys and Norumbega Park)</i>

        narrative: `
This poetry press was founded by a cooperative group of poets, including five women and 
two men. It was named for Alice James, the sister of William and Henry James, whose gifts 
as a writer were recognized only after her death. <Br><Br>The founding members, who included Patricia
 Cumming, Marjorie Fletcher, Jean Pedrick, Lee Rudolph, Ron Schreiber, Betsy Sholl, and 
 Cornelia Veenendaal, had as a primary purpose the encouragement of women poets. Patricia
 Cumming, who was then the head of the Writing Program at MIT, was able to obtain the use 
 of MIT Press for typesetting and printing the poetry publications.<br><Br>

     The cooperative press was situated at 135 Mount Auburn Street in Cambridge and required
      the poets whose works were accepted for publication to spend some time working at the 
      press. By the 1980s, the group had expanded to include eleven women and two men and 
      included the widely recognized poets Ruth Whitman and Jane Kenyon. In 1987, the Women's 
      National Book Association recognized Marjorie Fletcher, then president of the press, 
      as one of the "70 women who have made a difference."<Br><Br>

      In 2006, Betsy Sholl, one of the founders of Alice James Books, reflected: <blockquote>

      "The experience of starting the press from the ground up
      was a heady one, not least because the organization put a special 
      emphasis on publishing poetry written by women. There really were 
      attitudes that made it hard for women to publish. 
      There weren't a lot of women being published, and male editors
       tended to be pretty disdainful."</blockquote>

     The press was featured in major publications including <i>Ms</i>, <i>Poets & Writers</i>, <i>Slate</i> and 
     <i>Poetry Daily</i>. Many authors that the press published went on to receive major poetry 
     awards and their books were reviewed in important literary journals. Recently, the 
     poet Jo Pitkin has described the excitement of working at Alice James Books with 
     feminist women poets in the 1980s.

            Born in Cambridge, Corinne Woodson Alleyne was
            educated in Boston and Philadelphia. 
            She knew she wanted to be a nurse from an early age, and one of her teachers helped her apply for the 
            right courses to achieve her dream: "If it wasn't for that teacher...I wonder...", she said in 1990.
            
            She was licensed 
            as a nurse in 1930, but
            was denied work for 12 years because she was an African American. She was finally
            hired during WWII, when there was a shortage of nurses. 
            <Br><Br>
            
            Corinne worked for several
            Boston hospitals and then as a private nurse, later becoming a Boston public
            health nursing supervisor. She lived during her retirement years in Roxbury,
            where she recorded many oral histories of senior citizens and did videography. 
            <Br><Br>
            She belonged to the Riverside Friendly Neighbors group in Cambridge and was a co-founder 
            (with Kathleen Walcott, Marie Davis, and E. Denise Simmons) of the Cambridge-based
             Ethnic Foundation, Inc., formed to
            collects stories and stage exhibits centered on Black history (she and her co-founders were recognized in 1989
            by the State Legislature for their work). She was also a booard member of the Cambridge
            Multicultural Arts Center.<Br><Br>

            Alleyne started to record stories when, as a nurse, she noticed elders sitting at home
             babysitting and said "Nobody talked to them. They needed listeners." So in her retirement
              she recorded their stories with a tape recorder, and later video cameras. In putting 
              together her displays, she says they <blockquote>"...stir nostalgic feelings and surprise the public 
              with what we have found."</blockquote>

            She was still heavily involved in committees and committed to 
            telling the stories of ordinary people through video well into her 80s.


            She was featured
            on a PBS program produced by the Smithsonian for her achievements as a senior
            citizen and parent and was honored by Boston's Mayor Menino in 1998. She was 93 when she
            died.

            Ellen M. Al-Wegayan was raised in West Roxbury
            and graduated from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in 1964. After
            living in Kuwait with her first husband, she returned to Boston and Cambridge
            to raise her daughter. <Br><Br>
            
            After working as a teacher, for many years she operated the Kirkland Family Day Care,
            and at the same time was active in community and school affairs. Among her civic
            activities, she was a founding member of Cambridge Tenants Union, a board member
            of the 
            <a href="bios.html?lNm=MassachusettsFeministFederalCreditUnion&mNm=&fNm=">
            Massachusetts Feminist Credit Union</a>, and active in the organization <em>Save Central
            Square</em>. Ellen lived on Kirkland Street in Cambridge.<Br><Br>
            Ellen was a strong advocate for affordable housing and rent control.
             While her no-holds-barred activism won both friends and detractors, 
             in 1993 Ellen wrote an opinion piece in the Chronicle calling for members
              of the Cambridge Tenants Union and the Small Property Owners Association 
              to meet to resolve their grievances. In it, she said<blockquote> "Many tenants in Cambridge 
              are concerned for small, economically pressed landlords, whose property is in
               need of repair, and who not coincidentally have some of the city's poorest 
               tenants...It isn't impossible for tenants, landlords and concerned citizens to 
               act together in the interest of the community and city."</blockquote>


            Her second husband was Bill Cunningham, who was also (and continues to be) a fierce housing advocate
            and the two of them worked together on housing issues in Cambridge.

            The goals of growth must shift. Instead of defining economic prosperity in terms of the
             GNP, which makes every bit of economic spending a plus, we have to look at different 
             kinds of measurement...the Valdez Exxon spill was good for the GNP. We need a new 
             measurement that talks about preservation and replenishment of the environment as an indicator."</blockquote>

        Dominga "Minnie" Andrade was a longtime resident of Cambridge, where she worked as a stitcher for a

    Dominga's parents emigrated from the African island Cape Verde (a Portuguese colony at the time). Her
    mother, Marianna "Mary" Fortes Gomes, arrived in 1898 and her father, Caesar Julio Lopes, in 1901. At
    the age of 15, Dominga started working in New Bedford as a cotton mill "doffer," replacing bobbins or
    spindles from a spinning frame as they ran out.<br><Br>

    At age 16, Dominga (who went by Minie or Minnie) married Ruffino Rosa Andrade, who was also from
    Cape Verde. They moved to Cambridge in the 1930s, where Dominga was employed as a cotton worker
    for many years and they lived at 41 Market Street. She was a longtime member of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union,
    an important labor union and one of the earliest to focus on women workers' rights. Dominga raised
    seven children in Cambridge and she and her husband lived at 41 Market Street for close to 60 years.<br><Br>
    Dominga died at home in Cambridge after a brief illness at the age of 95.

        </blockquote>
            Linda
            Archer was a longtime resident of Cambridge with a home at 345 Broadway in the Mid Cambridge
            neighborhood. She was a devoted member of the Pentecostal Tabernacle in
            Cambridge. <Br><Br>On July 9, 1999, Linda Archer
            was featured in a story carried on PBS and narrated
            by Bob Abernathy on the hospice approach for terminally ill patients adopted
            within Boston hospitals. In this, she showed a courageous and positive attitude
            towards her imminent death from inoperable lung cancer at the age of forty-seven.
            Three weeks after the taping of the show, she died. Her friends who visited
            her were struck by her attitude and spirit as well as her firm religious beliefs.
            One of them commented that her final days were perhaps the most important work
            of her life and that they were strengthened by the sense she communicated that &#8220;life
            makes sense no matter what the circumstances for those with the right attitude.&#8221;

        narrative: `
             Born in Argentina, Rita Arditti was one of the three
            daughters of a Sephardic Jewish family that had emigrated from Turkey. Under
            Peron's government, the national university was closed much of the time, making
            it hard for students to pursue their studies. In 1952 she came to the US and
            attended Barnard College in New York City for one year. After that she went
            to the University of Rome, Italy, where she earned a Doctorate in Biology. 
            <Br><Br>She
            came to the United States in 1965 to Brandeis University with a postdoctoral
            fellowship to the Biochemistry Department and in 1966 moved to Cambridge and lived at 11 Donnell Street. She
            then started a position as a Research Associate in the Department of Bacteriology
            and Immunology at Harvard Medical School. In the late sixties and early seventies
            she became involved with other socially active scientists in the group, &quot;Science
            for the People,&quot; that sought to expose the connections between science,
            the Vietnam War, and politics.
            <br>
            <br>After developing a course at Boston University
            entitled &quot;Biology and Social Issues&quot; in which she taught biological
            principles and the various ways in which they may be used in society to perpetuate
            inequality, she became involved with the feminist movement and co-founded, with
            three other women, <a href="bios.html?lNm=NewWords(Centerfor)&mNm=&fNm=">New Words</a>, a women's bookstore, in Cambridge in 1974. Starting
            as a single room rented from a restaurant on Kirkland Street, the store expanded
            to include an impressive collection of books, talks, and lectures, in a new
            location on Hampshire Street, contributing to build a strong community of women
            and to participation in civic dialogue. After 28 years of operation, the New
            Words bookstore was eventually transformed into the Center for <a href="bios.html?lNm=NewWords(Centerfor)&mNm=&fNm=">New Words</a>, its
            mission being to &quot;use the power and creativity of words and ideas to strengthen
            the voice of progressive and marginalized women in society.&quot; It is currently
            located at the YWCA building on Temple Street in Central Square, Cambridge.
            <br><br>
            In 1989, because of her experience living with
            breast cancer, she co-founded the Women's Community Cancer Project, a grassroots
            all-volunteer project committed to cancer education and prevention for women.
            The work of the Project has focused mostly on the connections between cancer
            and the environment. <br><Br>
            Her work on behalf of the Argentine Human Rights movement in the eighties brought
            her in contact with the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo in Argentina, a group
            committed to truth and justice and the restitution of their true identity to
            the children disappeared with their parents or born during the captivity of
            their kidnapped mothers during the 1976-1983 dictatorship. A long relationship
            with the Grandmother's group resulted in the publication of her book, <em>Searching
                for Life: The Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo and the Disappeared Children
                of Argentina</em>, published by The University of California Press in 1999.
                A reviewer wrote of her research and resulting book:
                <blockquote>
                "An acute and impassioned observer, Rita Arditti describes Argentina's 'dirty war'
                 years and the heroic struggle of a group of Argentine grandmothers who set out,
                  against all odds, to trace the whereabouts of their disappeared children and 
                  grandchildren. Admirably comprehensive, Searching for Life reminds us how 
                  ordinary citizens can stand up to tyranny and prevail." <Br>
                  —<i>Eric Stover, Director, Human Rights Center, University of California, Berkeley</i>
                  </blockquote>
            
            In 1994, she was the recipient of a Jessie Bernard
            Wise Women Award from the Center for Women Policy Studies in Washington, DC,
            and in 1999 she received the Peace and Justice Award from the City of Cambridge. In 2005, she was chosen to be one of the &quot;Women Who Dared&quot; from
            the Jewish Women's Archive. She was an Emeritus faculty member of the Union Institute
            and University where she taught for 30 years.

            Josie Avakian grew up on Norfolk Street in Somerville. By the 1960s, she had moved to the
            Jefferson Park development near Fresh Pond in Cambridge. Her father
            was a farmworker who also worked at Haymarket in Boston and her mother worked at a a restaurant. She 
            became a strong advocate for housing rights and a 
            supporter of working people in Cambridge. As a member of Jefferson Park Tenant Task Force,
            Josie served as the tenant advocate for residents of Jefferson Park
            and was a tireless spokesperson. <br><br>
            Josie first became a member of the Jefferson Park Tenant's Council as a teenager in 1972.
            By 1974 she had been elected Vice President of the North Cambridge Planning Team (NCPT), an elected body of
            neighborhood residents who monitor real eastate developments, "...speak up for an equitable share of 
            human and physical city services, and are generaally concerned with preserving and enhancing North Cambridge" life for families.
            
            By 1983, she had been elected president of the NCPT.<br><br>
            Josie volunteered for a youth free lunch program, advocated for safety at Jefferson Park (especially at the nearby
            railroad tracks), and helped organize free Thanksgiving meals in the neighborhood.
            Josie worked worked with the Cambridge City Hall, hospital personnel,
            and residents of Jefferson Park to form the first Teen Family Planning Clinic.<br><Br>
            Avakian was interviewed for a May 1984 article about safety in her neighborhood:
            <blockquote>
            "Josie Avakian, a resident since 1965 of the Jefferson Park housing development next to 
            Rindge Towers, has been trying to do something about the railroad crossing for over ten
             years. In 1973 after a sixth grade boy who lived in Jefferson Park was killed at 
             the nearby Sherman Street railroad crossing, Avakian said she and 25 other neighborhood
              residents went to the city council to ask that something be done to protect the safety
               of the area s residents, many of whom like those in Rindge Towers are poor and not 
               especially politically influential. <br><br>
               "She said the council looked Into the matter and 
               helped secure a promise from the Army Corps of Engineers to build a footbridge out of 
               surplus Army materials. Nothing was ever done, she said, because of squabbling over who 
               owned the land the bridge would be built on. She and several others tried again in 1977 
               following [another] death That time she said the city manager, several other city officials,
                and a group of tenants met with MBTA officials who said they would build a "grade crossing" 
                with railroad gates warning lights and a walkway that would enable people to walk easily over
                 the six-inch rails. <Br><Br>
                 "Six months later, she said, some rail construction work was done which 
                 did little but make the middle tracks higher and somewhat more difficult to cross. No grade 
                 crossings were ever installed. Four people have been killed and four people maimed she said 
                 and nothing has ever been done. Avakian noted, however, that a foot bridge is expected to be
                  constructed behind Jefferson Park as part of largescale renovations going on at the housing
                   development."

            </blockquote>
            In 1996, she worked as a member of the North Cambridge Crime Task Force. <br><br>In
            October 2005, less than a year after her death, a site near Jackson Street was dedicated in Josie's honor by the Cambridge
            City Council. The ceremony was conducted by Cambridge Mayor Walter Sullivan.<Br><Br>
            Josie's husband was John Avaikan, a Cambridge resident whose parents were from Armenia. 
            The two were married in July of 1958 in Cambridge and at first lived on Columbia Street, then 
            on Putnam Avenue, before moving to Jefferson Park.

        In March of 1975, when Janet Axelrod was a 23-year-old recent graduate of Barnard College, she was the only 
        full-time salaried staffer of the Haymarket Foundation, which was founded just eight months earlier by George 
        Pillsbury Jr, an heir of the Pillsbury baking company, to support organizations dedicated to radical social change. 
        <br><br>
        In a Boston Globe interview at that time, she explained: 

        <blockquote>
        "We gave money to the Cambridge Tenants Organizing Committee for their handbook on legal tactics. If they
         can organize successfully against rent change so that poor people won't be forced out of Cambridge, then 
         they can have a base of power to counteract established power...More 
         health advocacy needs to be done, too. The Somerville Women's Health Project is successfully 
        challenging local hospitals. People need to be made aware that they can control their own bodies...
        We're basically interested in people who can collectively get some control over their lives."
        </blockquote>

        The following is excerpted, with permission, from the 2021 obituary for Janet Axelrod written by her son Eli Plenk:

        <blockquote>
        <i>Cambridge Feminist Activist Who Transformed Philanthropy, Tech Culture, and Local Libraries</i><br><Br> Janet 
        Axelrod [was] an activist who reimagined the process of funding social movements and planted the seeds of
         progressive culture within the tech industry. 

        <br><Br>
        Axelrod lived in Cambridge for nearly fifty years, and in that time contributed to the city's unique 
        culture in myriad ways. She was born in New York City on November 1, 1951, to a socialist Jewish family, 
        and was a lifelong feminist, anti-capitalist and anti-racist. She joined Students for a Democratic Society
         (SDS) as a high schooler in New Haven, and worked to support Black Panther Party members on trial in the city. 
        <br><Br>Janet attended Barnard College, where she co-founded the Barnard Center for Research on Women, was
         a leader in the student movement, and wrote her thesis on women in rock music. The college recently honored
          her with its Millicent Carey McIntosh Award for Feminism. In 1973, Janet was the first staff hire at 
          Haymarket People's Fund, an organization which redistributed money from wealthy young people to grassroots 
          organizations throughout New England.

        <br><br> In 1981, Axelrod was once again a first employee, this time at Lotus, developer of the world's 
        first digital spreadsheet. The company grew exponentially soon after her hire, and she quickly became 
        Vice President of Human Resources. In that role she hired thousands of staff, prioritizing people from 
        marginalized communities, and championed the fight against workplace sexual harassment, pushed Lotus to
         align itself with the anti-apartheid movement, developed Lotus' anti-racism-focused foundation, and 
         ensured that Lotus was the first company in the country to guarantee equal benefits to same-sex partners. 
         In 1986, Janet began to divide her time between Lotus and Blackside, a film production company which during 
         her time there created Eyes on the Prize, a fourteen-part documentary widely viewed as the definitive visual 
         history of the Civil Rights Movement. 

        <br><Br>From 1999 until her death, she chaired the board of the Cambridge Public Library, leading the 
        development of a groundbreaking $95M new addition to the system's central branch. In addition, she was 
        a co-founder and longtime board member of South Africa Partners, and served on the boards of over a dozen
         other social justice organizations. For the past eleven years, Janet and seven of her close friends have
          made up the Brazilian-inspired drum band SheBoom.
        <br><Br> Axelrod believed strongly in building community, and had a remarkable ability to make everyone 
        she spoke to feel deeply seen and understood. This was especially true of her children, whom Janet spoke 
        of with deep admiration. Motherhood was a source of great pride and joy throughout her life, and she 
        believed strongly in a woman's right to choose any and all paths, including full-time parenting.
        </blockquote>

        In her late 20's, Axelrod helped form a collective which put together the 1979 "Amandla Festival
         of Unity" at Harvard Stadium, which was headlined by Bob Marley and the Wailers and featured Patti 
         LaBelle, Eddie Palmieri, and Babatunde Olatunji, and a speech from comedian and activist Dick Gregory.<Br><Br>

        Axelrod and her family lived for many years on Berekely Street in Cambridge. She was a part-time consultant in the late 1980s for Lotus and arranged six art shows per year, 
        highlighting local artists in two-dimensional media. In 1989, she was working to create an on-site 
        day care facility at Lotus and in the late 1990s, Axelrod wrote regular letters to the Cambridge 
        Chronicle as a Cambridge Public Library Trustee, advocating for the building of the new main branch 
        of the library on Broadway.<br><Br>

        In 2017, Hampshire College's group "Ethics for the Common Good" reported that Axelrod's "latest project" was
         Wealth Matters. The philantrhopy group worked to balance their counseling on "having wealth and <i>giving</i> wealth."
<Br><Br>
        In discussing her years of work on behalf the Cambridge Public Library system, Susan Flannery said of Axelrod: 
        <blockquote>
        “She believed in the power of democratic institutions to make people's lives better. The idea of 
        free and open access, available to everyone, really appealed to someone egalitarian like Janet.”</blockquote>
