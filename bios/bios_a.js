            Born in Ireland, Mary Manning went to London to
            study theater when she was 16 years old. After returning to Ireland, she worked

            and the Gate Theater in Dublin; she also wrote film criticism for the <em>Irish Statesman</em>.
            Two of her plays were produced at the Abbey Theater, and she worked collaboratively
            on several projects with the playwright Samuel Beckett, who had been her childhood
            friend. In 1935, she emigrated to Boston and married Mark De Wolfe Howe, a lawyer
            who became a professor at Harvard Law School. Her three daughters were raised
            in Cambridge. While in Cambridge, Mary Manning Howe wrote the novel, <em>Mount
                Venus</em> (1938), and was the drama director at Radcliffe College during World
            War II. She helped found the Poet's Theater in Cambridge, which produced
            some of Yeats' early plays and produced work by new playwrights in the
            1950s. After the death of her husband in 1967, she returned to Dublin as theater
            critic for <em>The Irish Times</em>. In 1980, she returned to Cambridge and
            married her lawyer, Faneuil Adams.<br>
            <br>Her writings include the novel <em>The Last Chronicles
                of Ballyfungus</em> (1978), a humorous view of the Anglo-Irish gentry, and the

            a one woman show at the Fourth International Women Playwright's Conference
            held in Galway shortly before her death at the age of 93. One daughter, Susan
            Howe (born in 1937), went on to become a well-known poet and professor at State
            University of New York, Buffalo.  Her daughter Fanny Howe, became a novelist
            and poet, teaching creative writing at MIT and Tufts and at University of California,
            San Diego.  She also published novels that depicted the Cambridge and Boston area in
            the 1970s. Her correspondence
            with Samuel Beckett is held in the Samuel Beckett Collection at the University
            of Texas, Austin, and her correspondence with her daughters at the University
            of California, San Diego.

            on religious and historical themes. Her first book was a list of religious groups
            entitled <em>Alphabetical Compendium of the Various Sects Which Have Appeared
                From the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Present </em>(1784), This went

            works, <em>A Summary History of New-England </em>(1799), and <em>A History of
                the Jews</em> (1812).<br><br> She began to attract friends among literary and religious
            men in Boston who provided an annuity for her. She produced a final study, <em>Letters

            influence on her contemporaries and was among the first persons to be buried
            at Mount Auburn Cemetery. An autobiographical memoir of her life appeared the

            In 1850, Elizabeth Cabot Cary married Louis
            Agassiz, founder of the Museum of Comparative
            Zoology at Harvard, where he was a teacher. She
            took on the role of stepmother to his three
            children by his first marriage. Five years later, she
            opened a girls' school in their home at 36 Quincy
            Street, Cambridge, where Agassiz and a number
            of other Harvard professors lectured. Until 1863,
            when the closed, it provided a small income and
            addressed the need for the education of young
            women. Elizabeth Agassiz took notes on her
            husband's lectures and published introductory
            texts on natural history with her stepson, the
            oceanographer and natural historian, Alexander
            Agassiz. <br><Br>
            
            In 1865, she co-authored a record of her
            husband's expedition to Brazil, <EM>A Journey in Brazil</EM>.
            Later, she served as scribe for the Hassler
            Expedition (1872), providing the only account of
            her husband's last theories on glaciation. After
            Louis Agassiz's death in 1873, Elizabeth joined six
            other women in an attempt to persuade Harvard
            to open its doors to women. The result was the
            Harvard Annex, founded in 1879, which later

            became Radcliffe College. She used her influence
            to convince those who believed that women
            students should be offered the same courses as
             men and be taught by the same
            professors. At the age of 72, she accepted the first
            presidency of Radcliffe and remained at its head
            until 1902. Shortly before her death she moved
            from Cambridge to Arlington Heights, where she
            died in 1907 at the age of seventy-five.

This poetry press was founded by a cooperative group of poets, including five women and 
two men. It was named for Alice James, the sister of William and Henry James, whose gifts 
as a writer were recognized only after her death. The founding members, who included Patricia
 Cumming, Marjorie Fletcher, Jean Pedrick, Lee Rudolph, Ron Schreiber, Betsy Sholl, and 
 Cornelia Veenendaal, had as a primary purpose the encouragement of women poets. Patricia
 Cumming, who was then the head of the Writing Program at MIT, was able to obtain the use 
 of MIT Press for typesetting and printing the poetry publications.<br>
     The cooperative press was situated at 135 Mount Auburn Street in Cambridge and required
      the poets whose works were accepted for publication to spend some time working at the 
      press. By the 1980s, the group had expanded to include eleven women and two men and 
      included the widely recognized poets Ruth Whitman and Jane Kenyon. In 1987, the Women's 
      National Book Association recognized Marjorie Fletcher, then president of the press, 
      as one of the "70 women who have made a difference."<Br>
     The press was featured in major publications including Ms, Poets & Writers, Slate and 
     Poetry Daily. Many authors that the press published went on to receive major poetry 
     awards and their books were reviewed in important literary journals. Recently, the 
     poet Jo Pitkin has described the excitement of working at Alice James Books with 
     feminist women poets in the 1980s.

            Born in Cambridge, Corinne Woodson Alleyne was
            educated in Boston and Philadelphia. She was licensed as a nurse in 1930, but
            was denied work for 12 years because she was an African American. She was finally
            hired during WWII, when there was a shortage of nurses. She worked for several
            Boston hospitals and then as a private nurse, later becoming a Boston public
            health nursing supervisor. She lived during her retirement years in Roxbury,
            where she recorded many oral histories of senior citizens. She was featured
            on a PBS program produced by the Smithsonian for her achievements as a senior
            citizen/parent and was honored by Mayor Menino in 1998. She was 93 when she
            died.

            anthropometry- the measurement of the human body. She mounted the first demonstration
            of the English game of field hockey in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in a courtyard
            adjacent to the Harvard University gymnasium. She then arranged a series of

            1920 Olympics in Antwerp was rejected. She founded the American Field Hockey
            Association in 1901 and headed it for twenty years, then founding the United
            States Field Hockey Association in 1922. She was for 10 years the editor and

            Three weeks after the taping of the show, she died. Her friends who visited
            her were struck by her attitude and spirit as well as her firm religious beliefs.

             Born in Argentina, Rita Arditti is one of the three
            daughters of a Sephardic Jewish family that had emigrated from Turkey. Under
            Peron's government, the national university was closed much of the time, making
            it hard for students to pursue their studies. In 1952 she came to the US and
            attended Barnard College in New York City for one year. After that she went
            to the University of Rome, Italy, where she earned a Doctorate in Biology. She
            came to the United States in 1965 to Brandeis University with a postdoctoral
            fellowship to the Biochemistry Department and in 1966 moved to Cambridge. She
            then started a position as a Research Associate in the Department of Bacteriology
            and Immunology at Harvard Medical School. In the late sixties and early seventies
            she became involved with other socially active scientists in the group, &quot;Science
            for the People,&quot; that sought to expose the connections between science,
            the Vietnam War, and politics.
            <br>
            <br>After developing a course at Boston University
            entitled &quot;Biology and Social Issues&quot; in which she taught biological
            principles and the various ways in which they may be used in society to perpetuate
            inequality, she became involved with the feminist movement and co-founded, with
            three other women, New Words, a women's bookstore, in Cambridge in 1974. Starting
            as a single room rented from a restaurant on Kirkland Street, the store expanded
            to include an impressive collection of books, talks, and lectures, in a new
            location on Hampshire Street, contributing to build a strong community of women
            and to participation in civic dialogue. After 28 years of operation, the New
            Words bookstore was eventually transformed into the Center for New Words, its
            mission being to &quot;use the power and creativity of words and ideas to strengthen
            the voice of progressive and marginalized women in society.&quot; It is currently
            located at the YWCA building on Temple Street in Central Square, Cambridge.
            <br><br>
            In 1989, because of her experience living with
            breast cancer, she co-founded the Women's Community Cancer Project, a grassroots
            all-volunteer project committed to cancer education and prevention for women.
            The work of the Project has focused mostly on the connections between cancer
            and the environment. <br><Br>
            Her work on behalf of the Argentine Human Rights movement in the eighties brought
            her in contact with the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo in Argentina, a group
            committed to truth and justice and the restitution of their true identity to
            the children disappeared with their parents or born during the captivity of
            their kidnapped mothers during the 1976-1983 dictatorship. A long relationship
            with the Grandmother's group resulted in the publication of her book, <em>Searching
                for Life: The Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo and the Disappeared Children
                of Argentina</em>, published by The University of California Press in 1999.
            <br><br>
            In 1994, she was the recipient of a Jessie Bernard
            Wise Women Award from the Center for Women Policy Studies in Washington, DC,
            and in 1999 she received the Peace and Justice Award from the City of Cambridge,
            MA. In 2005, she was chosen to be one of the &quot;Women Who Dared&quot; from
            the Jewish Women's Archive. She is an Emeritus faculty member of the Union Institute
            and University where she taught for 30 years.
