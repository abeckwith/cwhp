            This school for young children was opened and co-founded by Kathy Roberts and
            Beth Rumnorzy in 1971 at 319 Huron Avenue in Cambridge. It is a childcare center influenced by the
            Freedom Schools of the 1960s, with a peace and justice philosophy. Freedom Schools
            were temporary, alternative free schools for African Americans. They were originally
            part of a nationwide effort during the Civil Rights Movement to organize African
            Americans to achieve social, political and economic equality in the United States.
            The most prominent example of Freedom Schools was in Mississippi in the August
            of 1964.<br><br>
            Kathy Roberts remained as the director from 1971
            to 2002. She envisioned the school as a place where the young children could
            escape the media barrage of
            commercial toys and programs and &#8220;focus on topics from nature, children's
            own experiences and literature.&#8221; She also felt that this would provide
            children with some ability to handle the influence of television when they
            entered elementary school. <br>

        Louise Agnes Nelson was born in Cambridge to Irish immigrants Neal and Julia Nelson. 
        Her father worked as an inspector in an auto plant.

        Louise grew up in East Cambridge on Otis St.  At the age of 34, 
        in the midst of World War II (August 5, 1943), she enlisted in the
        Women's Army Corps (WACS) and served in New Guinea and Manila. 
        She was on active duty until the end of the war.  <Br><br>

        Louise Nelson married Ralph John Darling and they had two children, 
        making their home on Inman St.  In 1950, Louise was appointed to the 
        Cambridge Police Department as the second female officer ever hired for such a
        position at the CPD.  As part of her work, she specialized in the difficult job 
        of rape cases and served on the vice squad.  In the 1960s, she was one of three 
        officers that made the original arrest of the Boston Strangler, Albert DeSalvo. She was living at 
        78 Dana Street in Cambridge at the time.<Br><br>

        In a 1967 letter to the editor, State Representative Thomas Doherty commended the 
        work of six CPD detectives and officers and Darling was one of them.  In 1977, 
        at age 57, Darling was selected as the top police officer of the year for 
        Massachusetts - she had served for 27 years at that point.   In 1979, she 
        was quoted in the <em>Cambridge Chronicle</em> lamenting the closing of the feminist 
        Boston Area Rape Crisis Center (located in Cambridge) saying that the center
        was a good resource and that there are "very nice, very capable, and very dedicated" people there. <Br><br>

        After retirement from the police force, she and her husband moved to Wells, 
        Maine, where she died at age 76.  Darling is still celebrated today by the 
        Cambridge Police Department for her groundbreaking role and excellence as a police officer.

            The Cambridge Chapter of the Daughters of Bilities (DOB) was a
            chapter of one of the first lesbian rights organizations formed in
            San Francisco by Del Martin, Phyllis
            Lyon, and six other women. <br><br>
            It was created initially to provide an alternative
            to the gay bar scene. Bilitis was the fictional lesbian lover of Sappho as described
            in the poetry of Pierre Lou&yuml;s in <em>Songs of Bilitis</em> (1894). The &#8220;Daughters
            of Bilitis&#8221; name was intended as a sly reference to conservative organizations
            like the Daughters of the American Revolution and other similar groups. <Br><Br>The DOB
            achieved national prominence during the 1950s and 1960s, but split over disagreements
            in the 1970s about whether it should support gay rights or feminism. During its
            heyday, it had chapters throughout the US and Australia. Between 1959 and 1972,
            the DOB
            published a national newsletter, <em>The Ladder</em>. The Cambridge chapter of DOB held meetings at
            the Old Cambridge Baptist Church at 1151 Massachusetts Avenue well in to the 1990s.
            <Br><blockquote>
            "The heart of the organization was supporting lesbians in a safe place, 
            and ultimately they saw that lesbians from different groups needed 
            different kinds of support, so they started these discussion groups - lesbians over 35, 
            lesbians under 35, lesbians with children, single lesbians, they even had a trans group 
            at one point. These were led by people who had had training in leading discussions and 
            knowing what to do if there were any problems within the groups, and these went on for
             as long as the Daughters of Bilitis Boston-Cambridge chapter existed, which was about
              30 years."<br><br>

            Children&rsquo;s Task Force, that promotes healthy eating, increased physical activity for kids, gardens in
            all elementary schools and school wellness policies. The Task Force was an early and successful initiative
            for its time. <br><br>
             In 1994, Davis was elected to the Cambridge City Council, and served eight terms,
            including two as the City&rsquo;s Vice Mayor. Davis worked on a wide range of issues, especially city
            livability and environmental sustainability. Her efforts resulted in Cambridge&rsquo;s adoption of a Green
            Building policy for new buildings, and the Cambridge Compact for a Sustainable Future and the Net Zero Task
            Force. Davis also represented Cambridge nationally with leadership roles at the National League of Cities
            (NLC), as Chair of the NLC Energy, Environment and Natural Resources Committee and the NLC University
            Community Council, and as Board member for the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives
            (ICLEI). <br><br>
             Davis was elected the Mayor of the City of Cambridge in 2012, serving for two
            years. During her term, Davis focused on pedestrian and bicycling safety, neighborhood preservation, housing
            and issues especially important to children and seniors. Continuing her work from her early years on the
            School Committee, she fostered partnerships between MIT, Harvard, business and community organizations to
            work on issues related to urban planning, sustainable development and STEAM education. After she retired
            from city government, Davis continues to be an advocate for environmental issues, as a board member for the
            Mass Climate Action Network, the USGBC-MA, the green building council, and the Institute for Market
            Transformation, a national organization promoting energy efficiency in buildings. Davis also attended the
            Paris Climate Talks in 2015. <br><br>Davis divides her time between sustainability and artistic ventures, including
            drawing, watercolor painting and printmaking.

                Marcia
                Deihl was a folk musician, singer, writer, political and cultural activist and founding member of The
                New Harmony Sisterhood Band, a feminist folk five-member string band. Deihl was born in Asheville, North
                Carolina to Martha &ldquo;Polly&rdquo; Deihl and Rev. R. Irving Deihl, and spent her childhood in New
                York state. Both her parents were singers and performers, and Deihl&rsquo;s mother received numerous
                awards recognizing her service to her community. <br><br>Deihl moved to Boston to study music history and
                education at Boston University, where she earned a bachelor&rsquo;s degree. She received a
                master&rsquo;s degree in feminism and folk music from Cambridge-Goddard School for Social Change and a
                certificate in publishing and communications from Harvard University.
                Deihl worked for 30 years at Harvard&rsquo;s Tozzer Library. She died tragically in a bike accident in
                Cambridge, just as she began her retirement. Her brother David Deihl survives her, as well as nieces and
                nephews and cousins. <br><br>
                 Deihl wrote songs, essays, parodies and poems, transcribed folk music,
                contributed frequently to the Boston Globe&rsquo;s letters to the editor, was published on WBUR&rsquo;s
                Cognoscenti and kept a daily diary. Her publications, as writer, co-author and editor, include All Our
                Lives: A Women&rsquo;s Songbook (1976), &ldquo;Biphobia&rdquo; with Robyn Ochs (1992, 2010),
                &ldquo;Inventing a radical feminist bisexuality&rdquo;, and a transcription of Charlie King&rsquo;s
                songbook &ldquo;Songs for the Current Millennium&rdquo; (2013). Deihl&rsquo;s papers on women&rsquo;s
                music and her daily diaries, which span 50 years, will become part of the archives of the Schlesinger
                Library on the the History of Women in America at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. Her
                writings for the Bisexual Resource Center are now part of the Northeastern University Libraries Archives
                and Special Col-lections. <br><br>
                 In 1973, Deihl co-founded The New Harmony Sisterhood Band with Deborah
                Silverstein while students at Goddard-Cambridge Graduate School for Social Change. The group produced
                several records and regularly performed at gay and lesbian marches and rallies, women&rsquo;s
                celebrations, union drives and nuclear power protests, and went on tour, performing in Philadelphia,
                Virginia, North Carolina and Kentucky. The band&rsquo;s 1977 record &ldquo;And Ain&rsquo;t I a
                Woman?&rdquo; is in the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage. In 2006, the album was
                reissued by Smithsonian Folkways Recordings, the nonprofit record label of the Smithsonian. The record
                was inspired by Sojourner Truth&rsquo;s Speech at the 1851 Women&rsquo;s Convention in Akron, Ohio.
                Songs on that album include &ldquo;Union Maid&rdquo;, &ldquo;Cotton Mill Girls&rdquo; and
                &ldquo;Ballad&rdquo;. &ldquo;Union Maid&rdquo; appeared on HBO&rsquo;s 8th episode of the show
                &ldquo;Enlightened&rdquo; featuring Laura Dern. <br><br>
                 Deihl loved folk music, gospel and union hymns. She sang in the choir of
                the Old Cambridge Baptist Church and she performed on guitar and mandolin and sang in several other
                bands, including the Bunker Mountain Fiddlers, Otis Grove, Cowfolks&rsquo; Dream, the Oxymorons and the
                Raisinettes. Deihl also taught music in history workshops, such as &ldquo;Songs of Social Justice&rdquo;
                and &ldquo;Women&rsquo;s History Through Song,&rdquo; and was known locally for hosting &ldquo;Bizarre
                Song Parties&rdquo; at her home. She lived on Jefferson Street in Cambridge.<br><br>
                 Deihl was a longtime member and supporter of many social justice and
                community organizations, including the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, the Old
                Cambridge Baptist Church&rsquo;s racial justice committee, the Cambridge Peace Commission, the Bisexual
                Resource Center, the People&rsquo;s Music Network and an early member of the Cambridge Women&rsquo;s
                Heritage Project. She co-founded the Boston Bisexual Women&rsquo;s Network and was a volunteer and
                supporter of the Theater Offensive, a LGBTQ theater company. Additionally, she performed for many
                Cambridge organizations throughout her career. <br><br>

            Mary Andrews was daughter of Thomas Jefferson
            Andrews and his wife Juliette Robbins. She was educated in the Boston public
            schools and in 1846, married a Baptist Minister Rev. Charles Wheeler Denison,
            editor of the <em>Emancipator</em>, the first antislavery journal in New York.
            When her husband became an assistant editor to the <em>Boston Olive Branch</em>,
            the journal published her first written piece. <br><br>In 1847, she published her first
            novel, <em>Edna Etheril, The Boston Seamstress</em>, which was a success. During
            her lifetime, she published over eighty novels, writing under the pen names
            of N. I. Edson and Clara Vance. She also crusaded against alcohol in her book,
            

            <em>Gertrude Russel</em> (1849), published by the American Baptist Publication
            Society. Her novels, written in a lively style with colorful dialogue often
            depicted poor and struggling individuals overcoming temptations, concluding
            with the triumph of good over evil. With titles such as <em>Out of Prison</em>
            (1864), <em>Carrie Hamilton</em> (1866), <em>Led to the Light</em> (1867.) <em>That
                Wife of Mine</em> (1877) and <em>Cracker Joe</em> (1889) she endorsed conservative
            religious and social ideas, but did so with humor. Denison also contributed
            on a continuous basis to a number of popular periodicals, principally <em>Frank
                Leslie's Monthly</em>, <em>Harper's Weekly</em>, the <em>People's
                Home Journal</em>, and <em>Youth's Companion</em>. <br><br>During the last two
            years of the Civil War, her husband was a hospital chaplain in Washington D
            C and Mary served as a volunteer nurse. Soon after, the couple went to England
            where he wrote articles in defense of the Northern cause and later edited an
            American newspaper. In 1867 they returned to Washington where they lived for
            many years. <br><br>After his death in 1881, she remained at her home in Baltimore.
            Fourteen months before her death she came back to Cambridge to live in the house
            of her brother Dr. R. R. Andrews, where she died.`,

            Dorothea
            Dix was the daughter of Joseph and Mary (Bigelow) Dix. She opened her own school
            for young children in Worchester. Her talent as a teacher was so great that
            in 1819, she opened a school for girls in Boston but was forced to close it
            because of illness. <br><br>
            
            Dorothea wrote several books for young readers, including
            an elementary science textbook, <em>Conversations on Common Things </em>(1824),<em>
                Hymns for Children</em> (1825), and <em>American Moral Tales for Young Persons</em>
            (1832). In 1831, Dix opened a new school in Boston, where she taught until 1836,
            until she collapsed from phsycial and nervous exhaustion. While recuperating
            in Liverpool, England, she met several leading British reformers who shared
            with her their new ideas about the treatment of the mentally ill. 
            
            <br><br>In 1838, Dix
            returned to America to live quietly on the income left to her upon the death
            of her grandmother. Three years later, when a Harvard Divinity student asked
            her to teach Sunday school classes for women at the East Cambridge House of
            Correction she discovered that some women were incarcerated simply
    because they were mentally
            ill. Dix began to publicly expose the deplorable conditions in which both prisoners
            and the mentally ill were housed. With the support
            of Boston social reformers, such as Senator Charles Sumner and his close friends
            Samuel Gridley Howe, and Horace Mann, Dix spent the next eighteen months surveying
            jails, almshouses, and hospitals across the state. She then presented the Massachusetts
            Legislature with her findings, resulting in the immediate enlargement of the
            Worcester Asylum. 
            
            <br><br>
            Despite her recurring health problems, Dix expanded
            her investigations of conditions for the insane and mentally retarded throughout
            New England, New York, and eventually throughout most of the country. She pushed
            state governments to assume their proper care by producing &#8220;memorials&#8221;
            describing the appalling conditions. Altogether, Dix inspired the establishment
            of 32 state hospitals and 120 private and county hospitals. She expanded her
            survey to the prisons and published a book <em>Remarks on Prisons and Prison
                Discipline in the United States</em> (1845). <br><br>During the Civil War, she was named
            superintendent of army nurses and caused controversy when she excluded those
            attached to religious orders or anyone under thirty. After the war, she continued
            to visit hospitals, expanding her surveys to the South. <br><br>She died in New Jersey,
            at the age of eighty-five and was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery,
            Cambridge.`,

            Elizabeth Harris Glover established the first printing office in colonial
            America.
            Around the year 1630, Elizabeth Harris married Reverend Joseph (sometimes referred
            to as Jose or Josse) Glover in England with whom she had three children. Joseph
            Glover had been a minister in Surrey, England, but left his family to come to
            Boston as a member of the Massachusetts Bay Company, through which he obtained
            a two hundred acre farm near Boston. He returned to England in 1638 to bring
            over his family, which included Elizabeth, their three children, and another
            two children from his previous marriage. <br><br>The family brought with them a printing
            press and other supplies. Also on board was Stephen Daye, a locksmith by trade
            who was contracted to Glover, and Daye's family. Unfortunately, Joseph Glover
            died on their ocean voyage of a fever in 1638. <br><br>
            Elizabeth.Glover, with the approval of local magistrates and elders, set up
            the
            printing press in Cambridge and settled in a house in close proximity to Harvard
            College (Crooked Street, now Holyoke Street) and bought another house in which the Daye family lived and operated
            the printing press (later to become the Cambridge Press), that printed the first
            books in the colonies, <em>The Whole Book of Psalmes</em>, <em>The Liberties
                of the Massachusetts
                Colonies in New England</em> (now in the Boston Athenaeum), and the <em>Almanack</em> for the
            Years of <em>1639</em>, <em>1640</em>, and <em>4161</em>. <br><Br>
            In 1641, Elizabeth Glover married Henry Dunster, president of Harvard from
            1640-1654,
            who took over the supervision of the printing business upon her death in 1643.
            The Glover children later sued Dunster for a share of the estate. `,
