        narrative: `
         Dolores Zappala was born and raised in Cambridge, the daugther of Anthony and Dolores (Totsi) Zappala. She was educated in 
         Cambridge schools, graduating from Matignon High School in 1965. In the 1960s, while living at 23 Florence Street, she joined the Blessed
          Sacrament Color Guards (SAC) in Cambridge, and her sister Ann Marie soon followed her into the group.
           The young sisters' involvement persuaded their father (at their mother's urging) to become active in
            the organization with the result that he directed the SAC from the 1970s until his death in 1990.
             Dolores took on the roles of instructor, creative director (from 1980), manager, and finally 
             president of Blessed Sacrament Color Guards over a forty year period.

            SAC traces its origin back to the 1930's when a local parish, all-female drill team formed in the 
            Cambridgeport area of Cambridge, Massachusetts as a summer activity for young girls. The color guards 
            remained the only surviving all-female color guard in the world until 2001. The youngest groups 
            (the "B" and Cadet groups) still include only girls. The SAC is dedicated to teaching the marching
            and exhibition skills to “at risk” or disadvantaged youth who then perform throughout the world.
            Young women have been known to move across country and from Japan and other countries to join the group. 
            The SAC Juniors were World Class Finalists for 22 of the last 27 years, and have been WGI World Class medalists
                five times; earning the World Class Bronze Medals in 1988 and 2005, World Class Silver Medals in 
                1989 and 1996 and the World Class Gold Medal and WGI World Championship in 1990. From 1999 though
                2001, the SAC Juniors won three consecutive Eastern Massachusetts Titles. They placed among the 
                top ten of the international color guard association, the Winter Guard International (WGI) World Championships.

                Dolores Zappala served as President of the Board of Directors of the Winter Guard International 
            for more than a decade, guiding the organization through critical years. She continued as a member
            of the steering committee of the Winter Guard International as well as directing and influencing
            the Cambridge organization.
