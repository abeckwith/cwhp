        narrative: `
            Emily Parsons, the daughter of Catherine Amory
            (Chandler) and Theophilus Parsons, was born in Taunton and educated at Cambridge
            High School. She began to study nursing only at the beginning of the Civil War,
            when she was in her mid thirties. In spite of impaired vision, some deafness
            from scarlet fever, and lameness, she entered the nursing school at Massachusetts
            General Hospital. 
            
            <br><br>Following her training, she was placed in charge of a ward
            attending fifty wounded soldiers at Fort Schuyler Military Hospital on Long
            Island. Her health deteriorated further, but in spite of this she was given
            a position with the Western Sanitary Commission in Saint Louis, Missouri. There
            she worked at Lawson Hospital and later on a steamboat for wounded and ill soldiers,
            <i>City of Alton</i>. During this period, she contracted malaria. She was
            made supervisor of nurses at the Barracks Hospital, near St. Louis, the largest
            hospital in the area, where she reduced the death rate remarkably. After the
            war, the hospital began to serve freed slaves. <br><br>
            
            Recurrent malarial fevers sent her back to Massachusetts,
            where she raised money to establish her own charity hospital for women and children,
            which she opened in 1867 in a house on Prospect Street in Cambridgeport. After
            a year, the hospital was forced to move, but reopened in 1869 as the Cambridge
            Hospital for Women and Children, operating from a rented house (with two wards)
            on the corner of Hampshire and Prospect streets. It closed in 1871 for lack
            of funds. Parsons died in 1880 from stroke, but efforts to raise funds for a
            hospital continued in her memory. 
            
            <br><br>In 1883, Dr. Morrill Wyman purchased a nine-acre
            plot on the Charles River near Gerry's Landing, and the building of Mount
            Auburn Hospital began. The first hospital structure, still extant, was completed
            in 1886 and named the Parsons Building in honor of Emily Elizabeth Parsons.
            After her death, her father published her correspondence detailing her experiences
            as a war nurse, <i>Memoir of Emily Elizabeth Parsons </i>(1880). `,

            Yvonne Blumenthal was raised in a wealthy Manhattan
            family. She went to the University of Wisconsin, graduating in 1934. Soon after,
            she returned to New York and attended the School of Journalism at Columbia University.
            She started to volunteer at the Henry Street Settlement House and the National
            Refugee Service. During World War II, she trained as a nurse's aide and
            worked at Bellevue Hospital. After the war, she earned a master's degree
            in social work from the University of Pennsylvania and was a professional social
            worker for the next fifteen years.
            
            <br><br>
            She married Fritz Pappenheim, a German refugee, who was a political activist
            and professor of economics. The couple moved to Alabama when Fritz accepted
            a position at a black school, Talladega College; he taught there from 1944 to
            1952. At the college, Yvonne became keenly aware of racial discrimination, as
            she reported in a PBS documentary, <i>From Swastika to Jim Crow,</i> that
            recounted the experiences of Jewish refugees teaching at black colleges in the
            South. The couple moved to Cambridge in 1952, where Fritz Pappenheim wrote a
            groundbreaking study, <i>The Alienation of Modern Man</i> (1959), and continued
            to teach and lecture. <br><br>

            After her husband's death in 1964, Yvonne
            threw herself into working for social justice. During the late 1960s and early
            1970s, when she was living at 7 Linnean Street in Cambridge, she ran the Massachusetts Friends of the Southern Conference Education
            Fund and served as a member of the human rights coordinating committee at the
            American Friends Service Committee. For many years, she worked with Community
            Change, a Boston organization founded to fight racism, and in 1992 was awarded
            their Drylongso award, which honors ordinary people doing extraordinary work
            in the struggle to dismantle racism. The library of the organization was subsequently
            named in her honor. Other awards included the &#8220;Fighting for Women's
            Voices Award&#8221; from the Coalition for Basic Human Needs in 1994 and the
            Cambridge Peace Commission's &#8220;Peace and Justice Award&#8221; in
            1995. 
            
            <br><br>For twenty years before her death, she was a member of &#8220;Writers
            In Action,&#8221; a group that met weekly at her home to send letters to public
            officials and news outlets on various social and economic issues. Her last letter
            to the <i>Boston Globe</i> was sent only two weeks before her death. Over
            many years she was assistant to her neighbor, Philip Morrison, an atomic physicist
            and a peace activist, in his role as book editor of the <i>Scientific American</i>.
            She died in Cambridge at the age of ninety-five.`,

            Cecelia Helena Payne was born in England at the
            turn of the century to Elena (Pertz) and Edward John Payne. She attended St.
            Paul's Girls School and then studied for her undergraduate degree at Newnham
            College, University of Cambridge, England. 
            
            <br><br>In 1923, the year she finished, she
            joined the Harvard College Observatory. In 1925 she earned a Ph.D. in astronomy
            at Radcliffe College, the first person to obtain a Ph.D. in this subject from
            either Harvard or Radcliffe; she became part of the permanent staff of the observatory
            and began to pursue her interest in stars of high luminosity, about which she
            wrote an important book. She agreed to pursue the rather tedious work of photographic
            stellar photometry, but this led to her classic work on variable stars. 
            
            <br><br>
            In 1934 she married the Russian astronomer, Sergei
            Gaposchkin, with whom she had three children. The two published a classic work,
            <i>Variable Stars</i>, in 1938. Although husband and wife worked together,
            Cecelia was the more celebrated. In 1938 she was named an astronomer and lecturer
            at Harvard Observatory. In 1956 she was appointed Phillips Professor of Astronomy,
            becoming the first woman to receive a tenured professorship at Harvard University;
            she was also the first woman to serve as chair of the astronomy department.
            (In 1965, Harvard Observatory became part of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.)
            The most distinguished honor of the American Astronomical Society, the Russell
            Lectureship, was presented to her in 1977, in recognition of her role as one
            of the international leaders in astronomy.
            
            <br><br>
            In addition to establishing a place for women
            in science, Payne-Gaposchkin is noted for discovering the exploded nova of Hercules
            and devising new techniques for determining stellar magnitudes from photographic
            plates. She wrote an autobiography in 1984 in which she insisted that women
            needed to find a balance between their professional and home life. She died
            in 1979.`,

        narrative: `
            Born Harriet Melusina Fay, and called Zina, she
            was one of six daughters of Emily (Hopkins) and Reverend Charles Fay, an Episcopal
            priest. Melusina married the philosopher and scientist, Charles Sanders Peirce
            in 1862. The couple moved to a small house on Arrow Street in Cambridge. A Cambridge
            Historical Commission plaque marks the location of the house. Melusina was a
            friend of Alice James and the Norton family, all of whom lived close by. During
            this period, she explored the establishment of innovative cooperative kitchens
            and laundries with a small group of other Cambridge women. 
            
            <br><br>In a series of articles
            in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> (1868-1869), she suggested cooperative housekeeping
            as a prelude to cooperative retail selling by women, and recommended that the
            women who joined the cooperatives should be paid salaries to manage the business
            of obtaining goods, preparing meals, and hiring domestic help. She formed the
            Cooperative Housekeeping Association in 1870, but the experiment was short lived,
            following the objection of some of the members' husbands. <br><Br>

            A 1981 Cambridge Chronicle summary of a new book about Peirce's Cooperative
             (<i>The Grand Domestic Revolution</i>) gives the reader a visual of the Bow Street shop,
              on edge of Harvard Square:

            <blockquote>
            "...If you had brought your laundry to Bow St. over a century ago, you would have gone to a
             modest little establishment called the Cambridge Cooperative Housekeeping Society and found 
             yourself participating in a unique and radical (even by today's standards) experiment.
            <br><br>

            "The very proper lady who took your bundle over the counter would have been Melusina Fay Peirce...It 
            wasn't that the Peirces had fallen upon hard times...but that Zina, as she was know to famliars, had 
            embarked on a campaign to liberate housewives from the oppression of unpaid domestic work. The laundry
             was part of a cooperative where women performed household chores under one roof, and then charged their
              husbands for goods and services."
             </blockquote>

     
             The marriage of Melusina and Charles Peirce was strained.
            This has been attributed to his temper and infidelity. Although she accompanied
            her husband to Europe in 1875, Melusina separated from him later that year and
            returned home to the U.S. He began to live openly with another woman, Juliette
            Froissy, and the Peirces divorced in 1883. 
            
            <br><br>
             Melusina published on various topics, emphasizing different
            aspects of cooperative living. Her first book, <i>Co-operation</i> (1876),
            envisaged wider communities that would include communal work areas. In 1884
            she published <i>Co-operative Housekeeping</i>, subtitled, <i>how not to
                do it and how to do it: a study in sociology</i>. She had originally presented
            this material as a paper at the Illinois Social Science meeting in 1880, still
            promoting her ideas of the 1860s and 1870s. By 1903, she had patented a design
            for a cooperative apartment building with communal kitchens. 
            
            <br><br>She died in Watertown
            in 1923 at the age of 87 and is buried in Mt. Auburn Cemetery.`,

            Sylvia Piltch was born in Cambridge March 8, 1925,
            the youngest of six children. Her father, Hyman, came from Poland, her mother,
            Rebecca (Andelman) from Romania. The family lived at 167 Willow Streetin Cambridge. 
            As a youngster, she took on unusual jobs for
            a girl of her day, shining shoes and delivering newspapers, a mind set to which
            she attributes her later successes. She attended the Longfellow school and Cambridge High and Latin.
            <br><br>

            In a 1977 Cambridge Chronicle article, entitled, "Valiant Miss Piltch...", Dan McLaughlin wrote that...
           
            <blockquote>
            "Long before Women's Lib, Sylvia Piltch, of Dana St., Cambridge, chief physical therapist at
             Cambridge Hospital, was fighting for girls' rights. 
             More than 30 years ago, when she was eight 
             years old, she sold newspapers on the streets of East Cambridge to help support six younger
              children in the family, after her father's death. 
              
              <br><Br>
              "She grew up during an era when male chauvanism was a rugged 
              way of life for boys—and girls didn't have a chance. Sylvia, however, didn't run 
              from the bullies—she fought and won. 
              "One day as she was selling her papers, some neighborhood 
              toughs robbed her of $6.34. Police visited the boys' parents, explained the situation, and the 
              money was returned. That was the end of the matter as far as police were concerned, but Sylvia's
               pride was hurt, and she didn't forget that. She waited 
            until she could confront each of the three boys separately and gave each a thrashing. 
            
            <br><Br>
            "The boys didn't 
            complain to police. How could they tell that a girl beat them up? “We solved our problems in the
             neighborhood in those days,” Sylvia recalled. The little skirmishes paid off. She became 
             a basketball star at Cambridge High and Latin School, and was named the best girl athlete in 1942."
            </blockquote>
            
            As soon as the Second World War was declared,
            Sylvia responded by becoming an air raid warden. During the war, she attended
            Boston University's Sargent College for Physical Therapy. While in college,
            she joined the USO, entertaining the troops stationed at Camp Devens. Sylvia
            was also active in her synagogue, which collected clothing and food for refugees
            overseas. Her entire family was involved in either the Jewish War Veterans of
            Post 35 or the Ladies Auxiliary so it is not surprising that perhaps Sylvia's
            greatest contribution to the war effort was as a member of the Jewish War Veterans
            Auxiliary, visiting and entertaining &#8220;the boys&#8221; at many area hospitals,

            named president of the Cambridge Jewish War Veterans auxiliary.  In 1950, she
            was named state president and she continnued in that position at least until 1958. In
            1950, Cambridge branch set aside May 11, 1950 as "Sylvia Plitch Night" to honor her service. <br><br>

            Throughout her professional career, Sylvia Piltch pursued an extensive, pioneering

        narrative: `
        The following is excerpted, with permission, from a 2012 obituary for Kaethe Peters written by Matthew Peters:<br><br>
      <blockquote>  Kaethe Peters once wrote,         <blockquote>

        "I found from my experiences that it is essential to enrich one's own personality 
        to capacity so that one can give freely to others."
        </blockquote>

        Possessing a beautiful smile and utilizing her compassion for others, Katya worked for 80 years to improve 
        her community and the lives of other people. <br><br>

        Katya was born in Germany and left for England [according to lore] two days before the start of World War
         II, during which she lost both her parents and younger sister in the concentration camps. Shortly after 
         arriving in England, she was arrested for being an enemy alien and detained on the Isle of Man with 4,000 
         other Germans, Jews and Nazis alike. <br><br>

        Upon her release six months later, Katya began studying to be a social worker at the University of London
         while working full time. In 1949 she traveled to Israel to work with Arab families to improve their health,
          nutrition, and housing...Katya earned a Fulbright Scholarship to pursue her Masters degree at Columbia University,
           arriving in New York with $5 in her pocket. After marrying Stefan Peters, a mathematician, and earning her
            Masters degree, she moved to Cambridge in 1953.<br><br> 

        Katyas 60-year career in the Boston/Cambridge area was dedicated to the support of mentally challenged 
        children and their families. For many years she worked at Boston Children's Service, and was later the 
        Director of Social Services in the Shriver Center at the Water E. Fernald State School. In 1981 Katya 
        founded Integrated Foster Care, an agency that focused on placing developmentally challenged children 
        in foster homes and created programs to address their medical, educational, and recreational needs. <br><br>

        At the age of 83, Katya created a program in a special needs class in the Cambridge Rindge and Latin
         High School based on the Orff method of music therapy, and she went faithfully to oversee the program 
         up to the time of her death. <br><br>

        Katya also worked tirelessly to develop educational and community programs in Cambridge. She was a 
        founding member of both the Community Schools Program and the Enrichment Program, the Commissioner
         of the Cambridge Human Rights Commission for two years, a member of the Cambridge Community Foundation, 
         and once an active member of the PTA.<br><br> 

        She received the Jeanne V. Burton Award for Community Service in 2001. In addition, she received 
        numerous other forms of recognition from the City of Cambridge, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
        and the American Association of Mental Retardation for her work over the years. <br><br>

        Katya was happiest sitting on her sunny porch in Vinalhaven, Maine, with her husband, or when frequenting 
        one of her favorite restaurants, enjoying good food, drink, and conversation.</blockquote>
        <hr>
        Kaethe Peters lived at 93 Upland Road in Cambridge for several decades. <br><br>
        In a 1999 interview in the Cambridge Chronicle, Peters discussed the Orff Project that she had initiated at the high school, 
        where developmentally delayed students learned to use percussive, yet melodic, instruments (like the xylophone) in order to improve their
        capacity for learning in all subject areas: 
       
        <blockquote>"The most outstanding feature of these instruments is that anybody, however disabled or emotionally
       disturbed, can produce a beautiful tone. The element of failure, so prevalent in the teaching of disabled people,
       is thereby eliminated."
       </blockquote>
       In the <i>Boston Globe's</i> obituary, State Representative Alice Wolf was quoted as saying of Peters:
       
       <blockquote>
        "Kathy was a very active member of the Cambridge community. Children were really her area of interest. 
        She was very outgoing and very feisty, an activist and an advocate, and she always had a smile on her face."
       </blockquote>
