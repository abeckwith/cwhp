            Daughter
            of Mary Josephine (Barron) and Thomas Christopher O'Dwyer, Sr., Mary Jo
            grew up in North Cambridge at 30 Dudley Street and attended local schools. Following the sudden
            death of her father, a World War II veteran, she decided to join the Navy Nurse
            Corps in 1967. With a Navy Nurse Corps officer candidate scholarship, she was
            able to study for her BS degree in Nursing at St. Anselm's College in
            Manchester, New Hampshire. 
            
            <Br><Br>After graduation in 1969, she was assigned to the
            naval hospital in Memphis Tennessee where she cared for injured servicemen returning
            from Vietnam. From there, she was assigned to a hospital in Naples, Italy until
            her release from active service in 1973. <br><br>

            As a reserve officer, then Lieutenant Majors,
            continued her education and obtained the degree Master of Science in Nursing
            as a Clinical Specialist in Medical Surgical Nursing at Boston University in
            1977. Following this, she held many important positions. She was Director of
            Nursing Services and Director of Training for a Naval Reserve Fleet Hospital
            in Florida, and held assignments in the offices of the Director of the Navy
            Nurse Corps, the Director of the Naval Reserve, and at the Bureau of Medicine
            and Surgery and the Bureau of Naval Personnel. 
            
            <br><br>During the Gulf War (Operation
            Desert Shield and Storm), she served on special active duty as the first Reserve
            Special Assistant to the Chief Nurse at the National Naval Medical Center in
            Bethesda, Maryland where she assisted with the deployment of active duty staff
            to the Navy Hospital Ship Comfort and oversaw the staffing of the hospital by
            medical reservists. From 1997-98, she was assigned to the office of an Assistant
            Secretary of Defense in the Pentagon, where she worked to improve medical and
            dental benefits for military service reservists and retirees. <br><br>
            Captain Majors retired from the Navy in March
            2011 and now serves as a volunteer as the Command Ombudsman for the Naval Operations
            Support Center in Quincy, MA. She served as a mentor to countless young
            women and men at various stages in their military careers. She volunteers as
            the Navy Nurse Corps Advisor to the Navy Nurse Corps Option Midshipmen in the
            Boston Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps Consortium; as an interviewer for
            the Navy Recruiting District New England Officer Programs; as an Admissions
            Information Officer for the US Naval Academy to assist the admissions office
            with prospective high school and college students; and as an advisor and support
            staff to the medical department staff and crew of the USS Constitution.<br><br>
            Her military awards include the Meritorious Service Medal, the Joint Service
            Commendation Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, the Joint
            Service Achievement Medal, Meritorious Unit Commendation, National Defense Service
            Medal, Global War on Terrorism Medal, and the Armed Forces Service Medal.<br><br>
            She continued an active civilian life working
            at the South Cove Community Health Center in Boston, an organization that serves
            over 25,000 primarily Asian patients with limited income and resources. Here
            she took on the task of Director of Clinical Operations/Director of Nursing/Emergency
            Preparedness Coordinator, Quality Assurance and Quality Improvement Coordinator,
            and is the Coordinator of the bone density program.<br><br>
            Captain Mary Jo Majors was honored in November
            2010 as the &#8220;Outstanding Woman Veteran of the Year&#8221; by the Massachusetts
            Department of Veterans' Services at the State House where Cambridge Mayor
            David Maher presented her with a City Council resolution and a key to the city.<Br><Br>
            In a 2010 interview, Majors talked about her service:
            <blockquote>
            "[W]hy am I so proud to be a veteran? Because I live in Massachusets, a state that believes
             and demonstrates that women veterans are special and unique veterans and we deserve to be 
             appreciated for our service to our country. <Br><Br>
            "Because I live in the city of Cambridge - North Cambridge particularly - a city that honors
             and pays tribute to all of its veterans by holding an annual ceremony on Veterans Day.<br><br>
            "Because I'm the daughter of a veteran, my Irish immigrant father willingly served his country
             in the Army during World War II.
            <br><Br>
            "Because I'm in the U.S. Navy and I'm one of the 4,000 Navy nurses that are serving in active
             duty or in the reserves, in the United States or in Iraq or Afghanistan or other  countries."
            </blockquote>
            Captain majors was recognized as the &quot;2012 Alumni Humanitarian of the Year&quot;
            by St. Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire and by the Boston Red Sox
            as an outstanding military service member in June of 2012. The Massachusetts
            Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) awarded Capt. Majors with its 2013
            Outstanding Veteran Volunteer Award at a ceremony in March. She was selected
            for the award from a group of 40 candidates from each of the 40 DAR chapters
            in the state. In March 2014, she received the &quot;Patriot's Award&quot; from
            the Ahern Family Charitable Foundation, the first woman and first woman veteran
            to receive the award.

        narrative: `
            The term second wave feminism refers to the feminist activity and thought that
            took root in the late 1960s and continued for approximately two decades primarily in industrialized nations
            in the West. As the women&rsquo;s movement sparked across the United States, Cambridge became a center of
            revolution and organizing, much like New York, San Francisco, and other major U.S. cities twice its size.
            From a protest of Harvard University&rsquo;s 1970 commencement led by Saundra Graham insisting on low-income
            housing for the Riverside community to the famous 1971 takeover of a Harvard building by local women at 888
            Memorial Drive, Cambridge activists were demanding changes locally that were similar to the national
            movement&rsquo;s call for greater access to health and child care, ending the Vietnam War, and condemning
            sexual violence. <br><br>
            In Inman Square, a feminist-owned bookstore, a credit union, restaurants, and
            shops became some of the new, essential meeting spaces of the movement. Women who had lived for years in
            different Cambridge neighborhoods were joined in the movement by an influx of women who found Cambridge to
            be a welcoming community.<br><br>
            From 2018 to 2020, Kimm Topping, Feminist and Queer History Scholar and Youth
            Educator, researched Cambridge history, conducted interviews with Cambridge feminists, and wrote and
            produced the <em>Mapping Feminist History</em> guidebook. Kimm also organized and led Walking Tours. The
            Mapping Feminist Guide highlights feminist, socialist, and educational institutions that emerged and thrived
            in Inman Square from the 1970s through the 1990s. These places, also featured in this database, are part of
            Cambridge feminist history. The Mapping Feminist Cambridge project acknowledges that most feminist
            organizing has experienced and experiences exclusions of race, class, gender identity, religion, and
            disability. A need still remains to address the intersections of all identity groups and their contributions
            to the feminist movement.`,

            No birth date or name has been discovered for
            the Squaw Sachem (or female ruler), widow of Nanpashemet, who ruled over the
            Massachuset federation of tribes. She married Nanapashemet sometime between
            1600 and 1608, during which time her first son was born. She had three living
            sons and a daughter, born over the next ten years. Her husband was killed in
            a devastating raid by the Micmac Indians in 1619, following which she was named
            Squaw Sachem with four tribes still loyal to her. <br><br>Her territory extended from
            Charlestown (including areas that are now Cambridge, Somerville, Medford, and
            Arlington) to Concord and up to Marblehead. Sometime in the 1620s she married
            her husband's medicine man, Webcowit, but retained her power. She placed
            her sons in control of different parts of her territory. Her oldest son, Wonohaquaham
            (called by the English Sagamore John), gave the English the right to settle
            in the area of Charlestown along the Charles River in 1627. He was to die a
            few years later from smallpox, as was one of her other sons, while the youngest
            (called by the English, Sagamore James) was badly disfigured. <br><br>In 1639, Squaw
            Sachem and Webcowit signed over to the English a large tract of land &#8220;within
            the bounds of Watertowne (sic) Cambridge and Boston&#8221; for the sum of 21
            coats, 19 fathom of wampum, and 3 bushels of corn. She reserved a large parcel
            of land bordering the west side of the Mystic Lakes for her use until her death,
            and also for the use of the Indians for planting, hunting, and fishing, &quot;while
            the Squaw liveth.&quot; She marked the treaty with the symbol of a bow and arrow.
            In 1644, she signed a treaty of submission to the English, agreeing to place
            her land and people under the control of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. She died
            around 1650 and is buried somewhere in what is now Medford.`,

            Helen Deane Markham was brought up in Springfield,
            Massachusetts, where she attended the public schools. She graduated from Wellesley College,
            then attended Brown University to pursue a graduate degree in biology, and took
            her Ph.D. in 1943. <Br><Br>She spent the following year as a lecturer at McGill University
            and came to live in Cambridge in 1944 and work in the Department of Anatomy
            at Harvard Medical School. Helen was the first female instructor and later the
            first female professor in the department. She did notable tissue research while
            in the department, collaborating with Roy O. Greep, who became dean of Harvard's
            Dental School. <br><br>

            She married George Markham in 1947. The couple was
            involved in various humanitarian endeavors. While an assistant professor at
            Harvard, her husband was the Progressive Party candidate for state representative.
            <br><br>
            Dr. Markham became the victim of McCarthy red-baiting
            at Harvard in 1953, when she was called before the Jenner Committee, but refused to answer most of the committee's questions. She was
            then denied tenure at Harvard and her position was terminated. She returned
            to Harvard later to work with Professor Alexander Forbes on visual mechanismas
            at the Biological Laboratories. <br><br>
            In 1957, Dr. Markham went to the Albert Einstein School
            of Medicine, where she rose to the rank of full professor (she lived at 387 Harvard Street at the time). She became recognized
            as a distinguished histochemist, doing significant work on the adrenal glands
            and ovaries, and publishing 147 journal articles. (Histochemistry is a biological
            science that uses various methods to identify certain cell or tissue structures
            on a microscopic level.) She was a founding member of the Histochemical Society.
            She died of breast cancer at the age of 49. Her husband, George F. Markham,

            Lorna Marshall wrote important studies on the
            !Kung tribe of Africa. She graduated with an English degree from the University
            of California, Berkeley, then taught English at Mount Holyoke College. In the
            1920s, she married Laurence Marshall, a co-founder of Raytheon Corporation,
            and settled in Cambridge, where they lived for many years. While her husband
            worked on magneton tubes used in radar for US and Allied ships during World
            War II, she helped integrate the Raytheon production lines. <br><br>In 1949, nearing the
            retirement of her husband from the company, the couple with their two children
            went to study the !Kung, a hunter-gatherer tribe in the Kalahari desert in southern
            Africa, the trip being sponsored by Harvard's Peabody Museum (they were living at 4 Bryant Street in Cambridge at the time). Lorna began
            to seriously study anthropology and produce scholarly papers. Lorna's
            teenage son, John, began to film her interviews and eventually became an acclaimed
            anthropological documentary filmmaker. Over a period of two decades, Lorna Marshall
            spent more time in Botswana and Namibia than she did in Cambridge, developing
            close personal ties to the !Kung. She published two well-received monographs,
            <em>!Kung of Nyae Nyae</em> (1975) and, when she was in her late nineties, <em>Nyae
                Nyae !Kung Belief and Rites </em>(1999). <br><br>

            <br>izabeth Marshall Thomas
            also became a serious student of anthropology. Only nineteen when she first
            went with her mother to Africa, Thomas continued her mother's work. As
            early as 1959, in her late twenties, Thomas published a study of the group,
            <em>The Harmless People</em>, which was highly praised.  `,

        narrative: `
            In the year following the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the nonprofit
            Massachusetts Feminist Federal Credit Union (MFFCU) opened in January as one of seventeen feminist credit
            unions across the country. The Credit Union hosted educational events, including &ldquo;The Language of
            Money and Investing: A Primer for Women,&rdquo; co-hosted with Harvard Women&rsquo;s Law Association in
            1980. Loans were made to members based on their need and ability to repay, and members had to be involved
            with one of five selected women&rsquo;s organizations in the area. Deposits to MFFCU were insured for up to
            $40,000 by the National Credit Union Administration.<br><br>
            In 1975, the feminist credit unions met to found the Feminist Economic Network
            and the Feminist Economic Alliance, which represented thousands of credit union members across the country.
            Contention among the groups which reflected issues of the feminist movement at the time; while some groups
            wanted to make decisions based on leadership, others wanted full consensus from every member of the group.
            <br><br>
            By 1976, MFFCU had 850 local members and had granted $258,000. The credit
            union eventually disbanded (date not available.)<br><br>
            Economic Independence: Groups like the Massachusetts Feminist Federal Credit Union
            helped women to obtain loans and financial education. The Boston Women&rsquo;s Fund, which still provides
            grants to community-based organizations, started at 186 Hampshire and supported many local feminists. In
            1968 job advertisements specifying gender became illegal. Before then, it was common to see ads titled
            &ldquo;Help Wanted &ndash; Female.&rdquo; In 1974, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act passed, which made it
            possible for single, widowed, divorced women to take out a loan without needing a man to cosign. Even so,
            women still faced many challenges in gaining economic independence. &ldquo;The problem, of course, is that
            it is hard to run a business built on consensus, especially when the process takes so much time. But many
            white middle class feminists did have time to devote to the process, which was as important as results in
            many of their organizations. Working-class women and mothers could resent the assumption that everyone had
            free time.&rdquo; (Spain, 2011)<br><br>

        Genevieve McGlinchey Mathison
            was the daughter of Sarah Clarke (1876-1959) and James J. McGlinchey (1872-1932)
            both of Cambridge, Massachusets. From 1918 until 1945 her home was at 9 Athens
            Street, near Harvard Square. As a young person she helped raise funds for the
            construction of St. Paul's Catholic Church on Mt. Auburn Street. Genevieve
            graduated at the top of her class at St. Paul's School in 1924 and entered
            Cambridge Latin where she enjoyed academics as well as sports, music, and dancing.
        
        <p>She attended Radcliffe College
            from 1928-1932 and majored in chemistry under James Bryant Conant, who would
            later become President of Harvard. Genevieve was very active in campus life
            at Radcliffe including roles as President of the Science, Exchange Editor for
            the Radcliffe News Daily, and member of the Radcliffe Orchestra. Professor Paul
            Buck urged Genevieve to run for the Cambridge School Committee after her graduation
            from Radcliffe in 1932. At the age of 21, she ran a campaign in the 1933 primary
            garnering her 11th place in the race with a total of 2,808 votes out of nearly
            16,000 cast. <br>
            <br>
            Genevieve was the sole support for her mother, aunt and two sisters. Her income
            financed the Radcliffe education of her sisters Grace and Anne. Due to the Depression,
            Genevieve's degree in science did not lead to the types of jobs that provided
            much income. She worked at the Cambridge Neighborhood House, the Registry of
            Motor Vehicles, Boston City Hospital, and as a substitute teacher for six years
            in the Cambridge public schools. From 1938 through 1939 she taught at the Webster
            School and from 1939 through 1942 she was a physics instructor at Cambridge
            High and Latin. During these years she was hard at work on her M.S. in physics
            from Boston College.
        </p>
        <p>During World War II she worked at
            Converse Laboratory, Harvard University, assisting Robert Woodward with his
            work on synthetic quinine; Woodward was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry
            in 1965. From 1943-1945, she contributed to the study of K-band radar at the
            Radiation Laboratory of M.I.T., working with Edward M. Purcell, who earned the
            Nobel Prize in Physics in 1952.</p>
        <p>For a brief time after her marriage
            to fellow physicist William Wallace Mathison (1913-1988), the couple lived in
            California where she worked as a physicist at the Naval Ordnance Test Station
            to improve the guidance system for the Sidewinder missile. She and Mathison
            had three daughters, Sarah Ann (1945), Marian Alice (1947), and Genevieve Elizabeth
            (1951), all of whom went on to careers in teaching. In 1951, the family returned
            to the east coast to live in Newport, Rhode Island. Genevieve and William both
            worked at the Naval Underwater Ordnance Station. She became the station's
            first female engineer and worked on testing and improving torpedoes.</p>
        <p>She was the first woman science department
            chair at Rogers High School in Newport. When she was in her seventies she was
            elected to the Newport School Committee, a position in which she served from
            1981-1982 and again from 1986-1994. As Secretary of the Newport Engineering
            Society in 1952, she initiated the first scholarships for young women in science.
            As the President of the Aquidneck Island Council of PTAs in the 1950s, she initiated
            a decade long program with the American Lung Association to test school age
            children for tuberculosis.</p>

        title: `Poet, Teacher, Activist`,

        deathDate: "",

        narrative: `
        Gail Lewis Beckwith was born in Cambridge in 1937 and grew up in Newton.  
        She graduated from Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, with an English degree.  In 1958, she married 
        the artist Michael Mazur and the couple made their home in Cambridge, living at first on a dead end
         street adjacent to the American Repertory Theater and later on Avon Hill, where Gail still resides. 
          In the midst of national turmoil in 1968, Mazur and her husband helped found the group Artists Against
           Racism and the War, raising awareness by creating art installations that focused on the devastation 
           occurring in Vietnam and participating in annual "Peace Readings".  Mike's art is in the collections 
           of most major museums in the U.S. today.<br><br>

        Although Gail had an English degree, her first real involvement in the community of poets didn't begin until
        the late 1960's when her childhood and lifelong friend Elsa Dorfman - who had become friends with many of
        the beat poets in Manhattan - took her to "hang out" at the Grolier Bookstore in Harvard Square.  Despite 
        the male-centered nature of the Grolier at that point, Mazur became a regular "lounge lizard" there 
        (as she describes it).  After the death of Grolier's founder Gordon Cairnie and the temporary closure of 
        the bookstore, Mazur founded the Blacksmith Poetry House to fill the void in the poetry community.  This 
        came about during a chance encounter with the director of the Cambridge Center for Adult Education (CCAE) - at 
        a 1973 gathering to discuss social and civic issue - that Mazur was told that there was a room open at the 
        CCAE in the evenings that she could use for poetry readings.  Mazur personally plastered Harvard Square with
        handmade fliers for this first small event, which eventually evolved into the Blacksmith House Poetry Series,
            a program that recently celebrated its 50th anniversary.  <br><br>

        Mazur was boosting the local poetry scene long before she became a poet herself.  She was awarded a literature
        fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1977 and her first book of poems, <em>Nightfire</em>, was published
        in 1978.  She went on to publish six more works of poetry, including 2001's They Can't Take That Away from Me 
        (a finalist for the National Book Award) and 2005's <em>Zeppo's First Wife: New and Selected Poems</em>, which went on
        to win the Massachusetts Book Prize.  Mazur is the 2005 recipient of the St. Botolph Club Foundation's 
        Distinguished Artist Award and was The Carl and Lily Pforzheimer Foundation Fellow for 2008-2009 at 
        the Harvard Radcliffe Institute.  She has also been a contributing editor at Boston Review, Agni, 
        and Ploughshares.<br><br>

        Mazur has shared her passion for poetry and writing in myriad ways.  She was a visiting professor at 
        the graduate writing programs of the University of Houston and the University of California at Irvine.  
        She has also taught creative writing in Boston University's MFA program and was the senior distinguished 
        writer-in-residence at Emerson College.  In addition, she was chair of the writing committee at the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown.<br><br>

        Mazur sees Cambridge as having been essential to the direction her life took: "I always say I could start 
        an autobiography with '...and then I moved to Cambridge.'  I was just so liking what I was doing. I met lots 
        of poets. And something about that store [Grolier] - it was sort of like a club that you could join by simply
        going in.  I could sit and listen to people talk, or sometimes I might say something, or laugh."  <br><br>

        The creative arts runs in Mazur's family: Gail's son Dan Mazur, a resident of Cambridge, is a graphic novelist 
        and her daughter, Kath&#235; Mazur, is an actress living in Los Angeles.

            Daughter of Gilman and Celenda S. Hatch, Estelle
            attended the local public schools in Jefferson, Maine until she was fourteen,
            when she matriculated at Wheaton seminary in Norton, Massachusetts. After three
            years, she returned to teach in Jefferson and after two years more, moved to
            the Boston area. She taught in the public schools of the Hyde Park neighborhood
            for three years and established a business training course there. She decided
            to study botany which had always interested her, and attended courses at Radcliffe
            College (then called the &#8220;Harvard Annex&#8221;) and also studied privately
            in hopes of teaching botany in a woman's college. <br><Br>She also began to publish
            articles in the Boston <em>Transcript</em> under the name of &#8220;Jean Kinkaid&#8221;.
            After a bout of illness, she had to drop out of public school teaching but continued
            to write newspaper articles for both the <em>Transcript</em> and the Boston<em>
                Globe</em> which soon accepted her as a regular journalist. <br><br>
            In October 1887, she married Samuel Merrill, an
            editor at the <em>Globe</em>, and the couple moved to Cambridge (45 Bellevue Avenue) where she continued
            to write for the paper and to participate in community affairs. She was a founding
            member and president of the Cantabrigia Club, and lectured on current events
            before the organization. She also served as an officer of the Associated Charities
            of Cambridge and other associations. She was a charter member of the New England
            Women's Press Association for which she was the first secretary and in
            1891 served as its president. <br><Br>
            In 1894, she started a magazine to further the
            New England kitchen movement in a magazine entitled <em>The New-England Kitchen</em>
            sponsored by the Household Economic Association. She co-edited a new magazine,
            <em>American Motherhood</em> with Dr Mary Wood-Allen that emphasized home-making
            and advice to women in the late 1890s that continued until 1909 or later. 
            <br><Br>
            In 1905, she established an insurance company
            in Boston, the American Birth Insurance Company, the first insurance company
            to cover births. She organized the company with other women with the intent
            of combining philanthropy with business, but the company went bankrupt two years
            later. She and her husband were listed as living at 45 Bellevue Avenue in Cambridge

                and then went to Bryn Mawr College, where she studied art history and
                English literature, graduating in 1927. The following year she studied Italian
                art in a Smith College seminar that studied in Florence, Northern Italy, Paris,
                and Central Europe. <br><br>She returned to Cambridge, where she lived for the rest
                of her life, earning her master's degree from Smith College in 1929. That year
                she began to work at the Fogg Art Museum as a research assistant under Paul
                Sachs, preparing a catalogue of his collection of drawings. She soon became
                an important part of the museum and from 1937 to 1947 her title was Keeper of
                Drawings. By 1947 she was named Curator of Drawings, the first woman to be named
                curator at the Fogg, retaining this title until her retirement in 1975. She
                was also an important administrator of the museum. Between 1951 and 1968 (when she was living at
                1558 Mass. Ave.), she
                rose from Assistant Director of the Fogg, to Associate Director, then Acting
                Director. From 1969 to 1971 she served as Director of the Fogg Museum, retiring
                in 1971, but retaining her position as Curator of Drawings for a further four
                years. <br><br>She produced a number of important catalogues, including: <em>Drawings

        narrative: `
            Dorothea Moore was the daughter Edward Caldwell
            Moore and Eliza Coe (Brown) Moore. Her father was a minister in the Congregational
            Church in Rhode Island until
            he was appointed a professor at Harvard in philosophy and theology. She attended
            attended the Gilman School in Cambridge and then a private school in Boston.
            She graduated from Byrn Mawr College in 1915 and when she was a senior she decided
            to become an MD. She attended Radcliffe Graduate School to prepare, took classes
            at Harvard Medical School (which still did not admit women into the regular program),
            completing her medical degree at Johns Hopkins Medical School in 1922 after
            working during World War I as a laboratory technician in bacteriology
            at an American
            Red Cross hospital in France. <br><br>
            Moore interned at Bellevue Hospital and worked
            in the clinics of the obstetrical department of New York State Department of
            Maternity, Infancy and Child Hygiene.
            In 1925, she was appointed as the first woman intern at New York Nursery and
            Child's Hospital in New York where she contracted diphtheria. Forced to recuperate
            for a year, she returned to intern in a pediatric department of University Hospital
            in Rochester. She then taught for a year at Yale Medical School, and then held
            a research position at Cornell Medical School before returning to Cambridge to
            practice. <br><br>
            In 1934, she established a successful thirty-year
            private practice in Cambridge and became an active member of the Child Care Association,
            the Head Start Program,
            and monthly well-child conferences in southern Massachusetts. She practiced also
            in the outpatient clinics of Children's Hospital in Boston and taught pediatrics
            at Harvard Medical School from 1937-1968. She was a fellow of the American Association
            of Pediatrics. In 1941, she married Arthur Burkhard, a professor of German literature
            but continued to practice under her own name. She published many articles
            in pediatric journals. From 1955 to 1985, she sat on the board of directors of
            the Cambridge Mental Health Association, retiring at the age of ninety. She died
            eleven years later, at 101.`,

            Born in New York City, Maud Cabot graduated from
            Barnard College in 1926 and traveled to Paris to study at the Sorbonne. She
            did not begin to paint until she was twenty-four when she met her future husband,
            the artist Pat Morgan, in the late 1920s in Paris. In 1929, the couple moved
            back to New York, where she studied at the Arts Student League under Kimon Nicolaides.
            She then studied with Hans Hofmann and began to exhibit at galleries in New
            York. In 1938 she had a successful show at the Julian Levy Gallery, during which
            some of her paintings sold to the Whitney Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of
            Art, and the Museum of Modern Art. 
            <br><br>In 1940 she and her husband moved to Andover,
            Massachusetts, where he taught art at Phillips Academy, and she began to teach at the nearby
            girls' boarding school, Abbot Academy. The couple had two children. In
            1957 she separated from her husband and moved to Boston, then, a few years later,
            to Cambridge, where she lived at 3 Howland Street and painted for the rest of her life. She continued
            to exhibit in New York, primarily at the Betty Parsons Gallery, where she was
            included in joint exhibitions with Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Robert Motherwell,
            and other notable contemporary artists. Morgan had two retrospective exhibitions,
            1967-1968 at the Fitchburg (Massachusetts) Art Museum, and 1977 at the Addison
            Gallery of American Art. In 1970, after her divorce was final, she spent six
            months in Africa. She returned to Cambridge and lectured on art at Harvard and
            MIT and taught at Lesley College's Institute for the Arts and Human Development.
            <br><br>
            In 1980 a film about Morgan's art, &#8220;Light
            Coming Through,&#8221; was produced by Rickie Leacock, the head of the MIT film
            department. The film premiered at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and was later
            shown at the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) in New York and the Place Pompidou
            in Paris. In her eighties and nineties, she continued painting, displaying continuing
            creativity. She received an Honor Award in 1987 from the Women's Caucus for
            Art. Since 1993 the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, which holds a number of her
            significant paintings, has awarded the Maud Morgan prize yearly to a mid-career
            woman artist. In 1995, at the age of ninety-two, she published an autobiography,
            <em>Maud's Journey: A Life From Art</em>. <br><br>She died four years later in
            Cambridge. Plans have been made to create an art museum and gallery in her honor
            in the carriage house behind the Agassiz Community Center at 20 Sacramento Street,
            Cambridge. `,

        narrative: `
            Kathleen "Kay" Morrison was born in
            Nova Scotia ca 1900. She was raised in Philadelphia where she attended Miss Hill's
            school. She did her undergraduate work at Bryn-Mawr College where she was editor
            and chief of the student paper. She met Robert Frost in 1918 at the college and
            invited him to lecture there when she was a senior in 1920. <br><br>
            After
            college Kay married Theodore (Ted) Morrison who was an English and Creative Writing
            professor at Harvard University from 1931 to 1963. The Morrisons originally
            lived on Mason Street in Cambridge. (Parini, p. 303.) In approximately 1939,
            they moved to a house on Walker Street in Cambridge. (Parini p. 328.)<br><br>
            Kay
            again met Robert Frost when a colleague of Ted's, Bernard DeVoto,
            brought Frost into the Harvard circle and the Cambridge area. Robert Frost
            and the Morrisons became close friends. Kay, Ted and Robert Frost continued
            their friendship throughout their lifetime. It is said they &#8220;made up
            a family of sorts.&#8221; (Parini, 315).<br><br>
            In
            1938, Robert Frost engaged Kay as his secretary, business manager and typist (Morrison lived at 9 Avon Street in Cambridge at the time).
            Kay found working for Frost to be a full-time job and she quit her part-time
            job as a reader at the Atlantic Monthly Press. Frost comments that Kay was
            one of four essential connections in his life. (Parini, p. 353.)<br><br>
            Ted
            Morrison was Director of the Bread Loaf Writers' conference at Middlebury
            College from 1932 &#8211; 1955. In the summer of 1939, Frost purchased the
            Homer Nobel Farm in Ripton, Vermont close to the College. During the summers,
            Robert Frost would reside in the cabin on the farm and the Morrison's
            would stay in the farm's main house.<br><br>
            Robert
            Frost held Kay in special regard. &#8220;The Silken Tent&#8221; is
            believed by many to have been written for her. It has been documented that &#8220;Never
            Again would Birds' Songs Be the Same&#8221; was written for her. The
            book of poems, A Witness Tree, which won Robert Frost the Pulitzer Prize in
            1943, is dedicated to &#8220;K.M. for her part in it.''<br><br>

            in 1988 leaving her with her daughter, Anne Smyth, four grandchildren and two
            great grandchildren. (New York Times, 1988.) `,

      Rosario Morales was an activist, feminist poet, visual artist, and major contemporary
       Puerto Rican author, with an interest in anthropology and radical social science.

            <Br><BR>

            Morales grew up in New York City speaking Spanish at home with her Puerto Rican immigrant
            parents and her siblings.  She transitioned to English as her primary language while
            attending New York City schools.  She joined the communist party in 1949, where she met Richard 
            (Dick) Levins. They married in 1950, and facing the blacklist and Dick's possible drafting
            into the Korean War, moved to Puerto Rico in 1951, where they farmed and had two children.
                In 1956 they returned to New York where Rosario was a visual artist and studied at City
                College in New York. They returned to Puerto Rico in 1961, where Rosario did oil painting,
                printmaking and explored a range of fiber arts. She was an amateur naturalist researching
                and drawing bromeliads, and began studying anthropology in summer programs at the 
                University of Michigan.

            <Br><BR>

            The family moved to Chicago in 1967, where Rosario entered the Masters program in 
            Anthropology at the University of Chicago and she and daughter Aurora were active 
            in the Chicago feminist movement.  They then moved to Cambridge in 1975 where Dick
            joined the faculty at the Harvard School of Public Health.  Morales and her 
            husband briefly taught a course together in a collective they formed called 
            The Center for Applied Science that was designed to look at learning, teaching, 
            and doing science as a collective.  They studied topics as varied as corn 
            pollination and ant colonies.  Rosario soon became involved in Cambridge political
            movements, including the Take Back the Night marches, and did poetry readings 
            and was part of several local writing groups.

            <Br><BR>

            In 1981, Rosario and Aurora both contributed pieces to <em>This Bridge Called My Back: 
            Writings by Radical Women of Color</em>, edited by Cher'rie Moraga and Gloria Anzald&#250;a, 
            and Morales would soon become a well-known figure among Cambridge feminists and poets.

            In the early 1980s, Morales gave regular poetry readings at the feminist bookstore
            New Words in Inman Square as well as at the Jefferson Park Writing Center, 
            Cambridge Poets in the Park, The Art of Black Music and Dance, and at the Strand
            Theatre in Dorchester.  She also did a reading live on WGBH radio for International Women's Day.   

            <Br><BR>

            In 1986, Morales published Getting Home Alive with her daughter Aurora, a groundbreaking 
            collection of multi-genre writing about being Puerto Rican women in

            Puerto Rico and the United States. Excerpts have been widely anthologized and 
            are used in textbooks from primary schools to graduate courses.

            In 1987, she was one of 18 Massachusetts poets and writers whose work was inscribed
            in granite and installed along the new Orange Line MBTA stations.  In 1990, she 
            was part of the Community Writers series.

            <Br><BR>

            In the late 1990s she became part of the Women's Community Cancer Project, 
            formed by feminist cancer activists in Cambridge, Boston and Lexington. 
            The group advocated for new medical, social, and political approaches 
            to cancer-particularly cancers that affect women and educated the public 
            about environmental carcinogens. With artist Be Sargent, the group co-created
            a mural, installed at 20 Church St. In Cambridge, depicting women activists 
            who had died of cancer.  Rosario died of multiple myeloma, a cancer associated 
            with the pesticide dieldrin, in 2011. Her daughter Aurora moved to Cambridge 
            that year, and in 2014 published a collection of her own and Rosario's prose writing,
            <em>Cosecha and Other Stories</em>.   

            <Br><BR>

            In 2005, Smith College's <em>Voices of Feminism Oral History Project</em> published an 
            extensive interview with Morales, reflecting on all parts of her life and her 
            life's work.  In it, she stated, "I fell in love with New England and really with
            the community of the feminist movement that I'm part of. It's my home. I've become
            a New Englander in every way. They'll have to carry me out feet first, is what I 
            keep saying...I have a lot of good friends here...I'm a member of the Women's 
            Community Cancer Project, which is a woman's group. So I have these whole networks 
            of friends, my writing group, of friends and groups and mostly women."
