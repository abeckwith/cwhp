        narrative: `
            Born in Cambridge to Edith (Guild) and Frank W.
            Taussig, a professor of economics at Harvard University, Helen Taussig graduated
            from the Cambridge School for Girls in 1917 and went on to study at Radcliffe
            College for two years. She graduated from the University of California, Berkeley,
            and then returned to her family home in Cambridge to study at Harvard Medical
            School. She conducted research on the heart, but could not receive a degree
            since the school did not formally admit women at that time. (Women were not
            admitted to the Medical School until 1948.) <br><br>After taking courses in anatomy
            at Boston University, she moved to Baltimore to attend John Hopkins University
            School of Medicine, earning her MD degree in 1927. Obtaining a fellowship in
            cardiology, she combined her interest in the heart with work in pediatrics.
            She remained at Johns Hopkins for the rest of her career, becoming one of the
            first women to attain the rank of full professor at the University by 1959.
            <br><br>
            Taussig is best known as the founder of pediatric
            cardiology. She suffered from partial deafness and was unable to use a stethoscope,
            which forced her to rely on other means of physical examination to diagnose
            congenital heart problems in children and led her to use the new technology
            of x-ray fluoroscopy. With the heart surgeon Alfred Blalock, she pioneered an
            operation in 1944 to correct the &#8220;blue baby&#8221; syndrome, a congenital
            heart syndrome in which an infant is born with a leaky septum of the heart and
            an undeveloped pulmonary artery. Her book, <em>Congenital Malfunctions of the
                Heart </em>(1947), became a classic on the subject. In the early 1960s, she
            traveled to Germany to examine children born with phocomelia (severely shortened
            limbs) as a result of their mothers' use of the anti-nausea drug, thalidomide.
            Her testimony before the Food and Drug Administration successfully kept this
            drug out of the United States. <br><br>
            She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom
            in 1964 and became the first woman president of the American Heart Association
            in 1965. Along with many other honors, she was elected a member of the National
            Academy of Sciences in 1973. She died in Pennsylvania in an automobile accident
            at the age of eighty-seven.`,

        narrative: `
             Born on June 24, 1888 in Hartford, Connecticut,
            Katharine was the daughter of Graham Taylor and Leah (Demarest) Taylor. She
            attended local Hartford elementary schools and then the Francis W. Parker School
            in Chicago, while her father was involved with the establishment of the settlement
            house, Chicago Commons. She went to Vassar College, graduating with an A.B in
            1910. She received her Masters degree from the University of Michigan in 1911.
            After traveling to Europe on an academic scholarship, she returned to her Vassar
            College as instructor in English from 1913-1916 and then joined the faculty
            of her former secondary school, the Parker School in Chicago, where she worked
            from 1916-1921. Unlike her older sister, Lea Demarest Taylor, who followed her
            father into settlement work, Katharine was dedicated to the field of education.<br><br>
            In 1921 when the philosopher, William Ernest Hocking
            and a group of other Harvard professors were looking for someone to direct a
            new coeducational and progressive school in Cambridge for their children, she
            was appointed as the first director of the Shady Hill School. She held that
            position for twenty eight years. One of the notable students under her directorship
            was the poet and writer, May Sarton, who described
            her experiences in one of her journals. Taylor also developed a teacher's training
            course that was highly successful, inspiring one of the graduates, Carmelita
            Hinton, to found Putney School in Vermont in 1934. <br><br>
            Retiring from Shady Hill in 1949, Taylor was made chair of the Education and
            Child Care Project in Germany under the auspices of the Unitarian Service Committee,
            a position she held until 1953. She went on to serve as consultant to the New
            World Foundation from 1955 to 1976 and as consultant to the International Schools
            Foundation from 1959 to-1960. Taylor sat on the board of Vassar College, Francis
            W. Parker School, Children to Palestine, and the New World Foundation.<br><br>
            Taylor died in Cambridge in 1979. After her death,
            her papers were given to the Schlesinger Library which included her correspondence
            with Agnes and William Ernest Hocking.

            Helen Meriwether Lewis began her early education
            in New York City, where her mother was a public school teacher, continuing her
            high school years at St. Catherine's School in Richmond, Virginia. She earned
            her <em>A.B.</em> from Radcliffe College in 1928 in government, but her interest
            in astronomy was stimulated by undergraduate work at the Harvard Observatory,
            where she assisted Professor Willem Luyten in identifying white dwarf stars.
            <br><br>She married Frederick M. Thomas shortly after her graduation from college and
            they had one son. The marriage ended and she found employment in many organizations.
            She worked for three years as secretary to Leon Campbell, who headed the American
            Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO), then affiliated with the Harvard
            Observatory. She joined the Observatory staff under the remarkable woman astronomer
            Cecelia Payne-Goposchkin. During
            the late 1930s she also began to work towards a Ph.D. in the history of science
            under the supervision of Harvard professor George Sarton, preparing a thesis
            on the history of observations of variable stars from the second century B.C.
            to the nineteenth century A.D. For this, she studied both Latin and Arabic texts.
            At the beginning of World War II, her graduate work was interrupted by war work,
            and her degree was not awarded until 1948. <br><br>
            Helen Lewis Thomas was &#8220;drafted&#8221; first
            into the Harvard Radio Research Laboratory and, shortly after, into the MIT
            Radiation Laboratory, where she worked with the historian of science, Henry
            Guerlac, preparing a history of the laboratory. In 1947 she was named a senior
            engineer at Raytheon Manufacturing Company, where she remained until 1954, working
            on guidance systems. She returned to MIT as an editor and head of publications
            at the MIT Research Laboratory of Electronics until her retirement in 1971.
           <br><br>In 1986, she was awarded a $50,000 prize by TWA for accurately predicting, thirty
            years before, the range, cruising speed, passenger capacity, and use of jet
            engines by commercial airlines (earning a listing in the <em>Guinness Book of
                World Records</em>). She died shortly before her ninety-second birthday, and
            a memorial service was held at Christ Church, Cambridge. `,

            One of the first African American women to graduate
            from Tufts Dental School, Mary Crutchfield was the first black woman to practice
            dentistry in the Boston area. The only child of William and Lydia Hatch Crutchfield,
            Mary was born in North Carolina and raised in Cambridge, Mass. After graduation
            from Tufts College Dental School in 1930, she worked at the Boston Dispensary,
            and founded the Children's Dental Clinic in her Cambridge home on Windsor
            Street. She was awarded a certificate in recognition of her contribution to
            the community for this clinic in 1938. She also worked as a dentist in the Cambridge

            Ruth Turner was a biologist and Curator of Malacology
            (mollusks) at Harvard Museum of Comparative Biology. She earned her bachelor's
            degree in education at Bridgewater State College and a master's degree
            in ornithology at Cornell University. She studied under William Clench, then
            curator of mollusks at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard, who continued
            to support her work. She obtained her Ph.D. degree in 1954 from the Harvard
            biology department (then granted to women only through Radcliffe College). <br><br>She
            co-edited with Clench the journal Johnsonia, dedicated to western Atlantic mollusks.
            After Clench retired, Turner took over his position at the Harvard museum. She
            became the world's expert on teredos, wood-boring bivalve mollusks, popularly
            known as &#8220;shipworms.&#8221; For this reason she was affectionately called
            &#8220;Lady Wormwood.&#8221; The U.S. Office of Naval Research funded much of
            Turner's research for over thirty years and found her work essential in understanding
            the deterioration of ships and dockage areas caused by shipworms. Working in
            collaboration with Dr. Robert Ballad of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,
            she used her knowledge of teredos to explain why wood remained in the wreckage
            of the doomed ocean liner the &#8220;Titanic&#8221;. <br><br>
            Turner was the first female scientist in the world
            to utilize the deep submergence research vehicle known as ALVIN for oceanographic
            research. An avid scuba diver well in to her 70's, she was one of the
            first female members of the prestigious Boston Sea Rovers and was honored with
            their Diver of the Year Award in 1972. She mentored hundreds of young biologists
            and readily provided free room and board at her Cambridge home to needy graduate
            students. In 1976, when affirmative action was implemented, Turner became one
            of Harvard's first tenured women professors as the Alexander Agassiz Professor
            of Malacology. Before her death, she received many awards and honorary degrees
            and served as consultant to many scientific organizations. `,
