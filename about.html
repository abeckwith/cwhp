                    The work
                    of the project committee began in 1996 to recognize and celebrate the contributions
                    of Cambridge women and women's organizations to the life of the city, commonwealth,
                    and nation from the foundation of Cambridge (Newtowne) in 1630 to the present</li>
                <li>
                    In addition to an organizing annual <b>International Women's Day</b> program, the
                    project committee has been researching, compiling, and editing hundreds of
                    biographical entries for individual women and organizations in order that
                    a database could be made available to the public. </li>
                <li> There are currently over
                    900 women and women's organizations that have been nominated to the database.
                    To date, <span id="total-women"></span> have been edited and are now made available
                    through this
                    website. This is our attempt to write women into history and honor their lives
                    and recognize their many accomplishments</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The database
                is a work in progress, but we would welcome your <a
                    href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/Historic/CWHP/cwhpnomination.pdf">nominations</a>,
                your corrections, or your time to help us research or edit the entries and
                improve the website design. A picture is worth a thousand words. We would
                like to add photographs to the written entries, but it will take time to collect
                the images and the necessary permissions to use them here on the website.
                If you would like to donate an image to the project, please <a href="#Contact">let
                    us know</a>.
                The
                entries in the database are organized alphabetically, and there is also a
                topical index, where one can find women by their occupation or area of interest
                (women doctors, social workers, writers, etc.). A search function is also
                in the works.

                    create on-going programs
                    to celebrate the women of Cambridge, past and present, from a variety of
                    ethnic
                    backgrounds and experiences and recognize their contributions to the life

            <p>
                The Cambridge Women's Heritage
                Project grew out of a grassroots effort to establish a memorial to writer May
                Sarton, which was accomplished with the dedication of a tree and plaque in her
                honor at the Cambridge Public Library's main branch in 1996. The committee
                continued
                to work toward a more formal program of commemorating the contributions of
                Cambridge
                women, and several members founded the Cambridge Women's Heritage Project
                Advisory
                Committee.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Advisory Committee is
                has been and continues to collect information on and accept nominations for
                the Cambridge Women's Heritage Database. The Database documents a diverse group
                of women and women's organizations that have impacted the lives of others in
                the community. Nominations are accepted for women's organizations and individual
                women, living or deceased, famous or locally known. There are currently over
                900 women and women's organizations that have been nominated to the Database.
                We have edited <span id="total2"></span> of these profiles and made them
                available through
                this website.
                This is our attempt to write women into history and honor their lives and
                recognize
                their many accomplishments.

        <div class="about-content">
            <p>
                Researching women and women's
                organizations is no easy task. Until recently, little has been written about
                women and their contributions to community, science, literature, education,
                government, religtion, etc. It's for this very reason that the Cambridge Women's
                Heritage Project felt it was necessary to begin collecting information about
                women's lives and women's organizations and to compile that information into
                a central research database, so that students, the media, and interested members
                of the public could learn about these important citizens of Cambridge.
            </p>
            <p>
                This effort is, by nature,
                a work in progress. We will continue to discover more women and women's
                organizations
                that have played an important role in the life of this city and beyond. We have
                completed and edited only a little more than a quarter of the nominees on our
                database. There is plenty more work to be done researching, fact checking, and
                editing the entries and then posting them to the website. We are interested
                in receiving new nominations as well as welcoming new members to our committee
                to help us with the project.

                    Women's names have been
                    entered as completely as possible</li>
                <li> Family names are not always included, but
                    are shown in parentheses, where known</li>
                <li> Entries are alphabetized by the married
                    last name for married women and by family name for unmarried women<br>
                    Examples:
                    Julia (McWilliams) Child is alphabetized under C and Maria Louise Baldwin is
                    alphabetized under B. This is true, with a few exceptions such as Margaret
                    Fuller,
                    who is much better known by her family name than her married name of
                    Margaret
                    F. Ossoli. Her entry is alphabetized under F, not O. For hyphenated names,
                    the
                    entry is alphabetized under the first letter of the hyphenate and a cross
                    reference
                    is provided</li>
                <li>
                    Birth and death dates (founding
                    and dissolution dates for organizations) have been provided as well as birth
                    and death locations, to the fullest extent known. Often, birth dates have
                    been
                    calculated based on the age at the time of death, as reported in an
                    obituary.
                    In these cases, we've given a circa date</li>
                <li>
                    References have been provided
                    for each entry. This is not an exhaustive bibliography, but a list of
                    sources
                    used by the committee. Some information has been provided by individuals who
                    submitted the nomination, but we've done our best to fact check the
                    information
                    in published sources. Additional reference information can be found on the
